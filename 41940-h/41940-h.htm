<p>COOKING FOR TWO is designed to give in simple and concise
style, those things that are essential to the proper selection and
preparation of a reasonable variety of food for a family of two
individuals. At the same time by simply doubling the quantity of each
ingredient given in a recipe, the dish prepared will serve four or more
people.</p>

<p>The food products considered in the recipes are such as the housekeeper
of average means would use on every day occasions, with a generous
sprinkling of choice articles for Sunday, or when a friend or two
have been invited to dinner, luncheon or high tea. Menus for a week
or two in each month are given.</p>

<p>There is much in the book that is interesting, even indispensable, to young housekeepers, or
those with little experience in cooking, while every housekeeper will find it contains much that
is new and helpful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<b>An ideal gift to a young housekeeper. The recipes are
practical and are designed, and really are, "For Two."</b></p>

<h2 class="p2">Quaint Customs and Toothsome Dainties</h2>

<p class="center">By Frances R. Sterrett</p>

<p class="p2">Popular hotels and big cafés
are much the same the world
over, whether you find them in
New York, Paris, Cairo or Calcutta.
There is the same staff of uniformed,
expectant servants, the same glittering
decorations and appointments, the
orchestra plays the same selections,
and the throng of well-dressed guests
looks as though it might have been
transported bodily from one to the
other. Love of variety sends the
traveler, away from all this glare and
glitter, to some quaint resort that had its
group of patrons when the United States
was young, and which still retains many
of the customs that were features of the
common life a century or more ago, and
that now are so unusual that they prove
strong magnets for the tourist.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody who goes to London
finds his way, sooner or later, to
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in Wine
Office Court. Tucked away, as it is,
just off of Fleet Street, it presents anything
but a pretentious appearance
and more than one party of timid
American women has hurried away,
disappointed at sight of its dingy
court. But the dinginess is all on the
outside; within, there is light and
warmth, and cheery greeting. The
Cheese was a coffee house beloved by
Samuel Johnson, and the chair in which
the great man sat, night after night,
while busy Boswell listened and took
copious notes of the interchange of
wits, is still there, standing now
beneath the big portrait of Dr. Johnson
that hangs on one side of the fireplace.
Oliver Goldsmith was also a regular
patron of the Cheese, which is one of
the few meeting places of the literati
of the eighteenth century that still
remain. Indeed, these old relics of the
past are fast disappearing. Five years
ago, when I first visited the Cheese,
the waiter, impressed with my interest
in the old associations, asked if I would
care to see the house in which Johnson
lived. It was near at hand, but he
said emphatically, "You'll have to
hurry for they are tearing it down at
this minute." Hurry we did and
arrived in time to see the dismantling
of the last row of windows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>Ye Olde Cheese is too good a source
of revenue for it to be destroyed, and
the prospects are that for years to
come Americans will flock there to
exclaim over the high paneled walls
and the sanded floors. The tables still
stand between high-backed benches,
over which the newspapers are hung,
as they were in Johnson's day. The
old grill is on the second floor, and over
its gleaming coals innumerable kidneys
and chops have been brought to culinary
perfection. Beefsteak pudding,
which is served on Wednesdays, with
all the pomp and ceremony of ancient
days, is an attraction that fills the
tables and sends away dozens of
envious men and women, who can get
no more than a sniff of the Old English
dish, as it is borne in triumph through
the rooms. Other days have their
specialities, but it is the beefsteak
pudding that is the favorite, and if
you delay your arrival, the prospects
are, you will have to be satisfied with
a kidney or a chop, for not a scrap of
pie is ever left.</p>

<p>But with toasted cheese to follow,
the kidney is not a bad substitute, and
it brings with it, also, a flavor of
Dickens and Thackeray, whose heroes
dined frequently on such fare. With
the luncheon comes Devonshire cider,
another speciality of the house, if you
do not care for beer or ale, but beer or
cider is served in reproductions of the
pewter mugs that Dr. Johnson drank
from, and, for a consideration, you can
carry one away, wrapped in an odd
bag of woven reeds.</p>

<p>The visitors' book at the Cheese
makes interesting reading while you
wait for your chop, for it is embellished
with pen drawings by the famous
artists of the world, and enriched with
sentiments from poets, novelists, musicians,
politicians, capitalists, and others
whose names are known on more than
one continent.</p>

<p class="p2">Buszard's on Oxford Street is not as
familiar to Americans, but it has an
interest of its own, for it has made
wedding cakes for royalty for many
years, and the models displayed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
show-room form an amusing exhibition
to the American who has little idea of
what a royal wedding cake should be.
There they stand six or seven feet tall
and in as many tiers, each ornamented
with almond icing, inches thick, and
sugar piping, with coats of arms and
heraldic devices, and bearing on top
a sugar temple surmounted by doves
and other hymeneal emblems.</p>

<p>The account of a fashionable wedding
in the English society papers usually
closes with the line, "Cake by Buszard"
or Bolland, for Buszard in London and
Bolland in Chester make most of the
wedding cakes that are served in
England, and they send hundreds of
them to the colonies, so that the
English bride, even if she be far from
home, can have "Cake by Buszard."</p>

<p>And most delectable cake it is, too,
and if you wander into the heavily
furnished, rather gloomy tea-room at
the tea hour, you will find it well filled
with city and country people and a
sprinkling of foreigners who are partaking
of the conventional afternoon
refreshment where their grandparents
or great grandparents, perhaps, were
refreshed. Tea for two shillings allows
you to eat all the cake you wish, but
unfortunately physical limitations prevent
you from trying half of the
delicious confections in the tray beside
you, the almond pound, Dundee, Maderia
simnel, rich currant, muscatel,
green ginger, cheese cakes and Scotch
short bread, all made from ancient
recipes. It is difficult to choose a
favorite, although the Scotch short
bread never tastes quite the same as
it does in one of the popular tea
rooms on Princes Street in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Newhaven, just outside of Edinburgh,
used to be more famous for its fish
dinners than it is now and, perhaps,
you will find no other party in the
hotel coffee room where at least four
kinds of fried fish, no one of which you
can find on this side of the water, are
served for a shilling, sixpence. Newhaven
is visited for its picturesque
fishwives; and the women look more
as though they had just been brought
from Holland than as descendants of
Scandinavians who crossed in the time
of James IV. They have been singularly
conservative in their habits, and,
owing to a strict custom of intermarriages,
there are only a few names
to be found in this colony of fisher
folk, who have to resort to nicknames
for identification.</p>

<p>If you are a tourist of the feminine
gender, you will probably stop at the
Globe Inn, in Dumfries, for a lemon
squash, or a ginger ale, although you
may be brave enough to ask the rosy-cheeked
landlady for a small glass of
what Robert Burns used to order; for
the Globe Inn is the Burns' Howff, and
down its narrow court the poet slipped
nightly to the brightly-lighted room
where his companions waited. The
chair in which the poet lolled is still
there, and a right stout affair it is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
and with stout arms. It is kept
securely locked behind wooden doors,
and the landlady made a great ceremony
of opening them and insisted on
each of us trying the capacious seat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you write poetry yourself?"
she asked; but we had to confess
that we felt no more gifted with
rhymes in Burns' chair than in our
own inglenook in America, and followed
her up the stairs to the old-time room
filled with relics.</p>

<p>"Americans come a long way to see
these old pieces," she said, as she
motioned majestically to a punch bowl,
and then moved to the window on
whose pane the poet had written the
verses to "The Lovely Polly Stewart."
"You seem to think a sight of Burns?
There was one American gentleman
who offered me a pot of money, if I
would let him take the Howff to a fair in
America, but I make a tidy living out
of it here and God knows if we would
ever live to cross the ocean. Burns lived
and died here, and what would do for
him will do for me," humbly.</p>

<p>There are many colleges in Oxford,
but at no one of them is the tourist
supposed to find refreshment in the
dining halls, so that it was something
of a triumph to be given a tart in one
of the quaint old kitchens. The tart
was really a tribute to an interest in
the pantry shelves which were filled
with pastry, and in the explanatory
list that hung beside them. Tarts have
been made in the same fashion at this
Oxford college for several hundred
years, in order, the cook explained, with
a twinkle in his eye, that the students
might get what they wanted, when
they slipped down on a night tart raid.
It is the nick in the edge that has told
generations of students the contents
of the tart; an apple has only one nick,
a mince has two at each end, a gooseberry
three, and so on until a student
who has learned the rule can choose his
favorite in the dark.</p>

<p>Winchester, the old royal city of
England, has so many places of interest,
the cathedral, the famous Winchester
school, the castle, in which hangs King
Arthur's round table as it has hung for
several hundred years, that the traveler
who is there but for a day may not have
time to share the wayfarer's dole at
St. Cross hospital which is distributed
today just as Bishop Henry de Blois,
a grandson of William the Conqueror,
arranged almost eight hundred years
ago. This wayfarer's dole consists of
a horn of ale and piece of white bread,
and anyone who knocks at the hatchway
of the porter's gate is entitled to
receive it. About thirty wayfarers are
given it daily as well as many notable
people and curious travelers who knock
at the door for the novelty of sharing
in a picturesque survival of a mediæval
charity. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote
of his experience, "Just before entering
Winchester we stopped at the Church
of St. Cross, and after looking through
the quaint antiquity we demanded a
piece of bread and a draught of ale,
which the founder, Henry de Blois, in
1136, commanded should be given to
everyone who should ask it at the gate.
We had both from the old couple who
take care of the church."</p>

<p>When you are in Paris you must not
forget Rumpelmeyer, the "king of
pastry makers." His shop is unpretentious,
considering his vogue, and the
room is all too small on a pleasant afternoon
for the throng which would invade
it. There are representatives from
the far corners of the world. Americans
are all about you; at the next table is
a Russian grand duchess, perhaps, with
her cavaliers; nearer the wall sits a
woman from the Orient, whose soft silk
draperies are in strange contrast to the
modish Parisiennes; a group of children
chatter of South Africa to their attendants
and two natives from India have
not doffed their spotless white turbans.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sharing in a Picturesque Survival of a Mediæval Charity</span></p>
</div>

<p>Rumpelmeyer's might be considered
a glorified cafeteria, and the great
moment of your visit to the café is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
when you have taken the fork and
plate from the smiling maid, and stand
hesitating beside the table laden with
cakes. And such cakes! Fluffy balls
rolled in chocolate and cocoanut, maple
crescents, diamonds of paste enriched
with French fruits, tiny tarts filled
with glacéd cherries, half an apricot
or a plum; cornets heaped with cream
of pistachio or strawberries, pastry and
sweetmeats in every appetizing form,
until it is difficult to make a choice.
At last with plate laden you find your
way to the table where something new
in ices, cool or hot drinks, is served.
And as you go away, you cast a lingering
glance at the patisserie table and
plan to come, again and again, until
you have tried every kind, not knowing
that new confections are offered every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
few days to make such a plan almost
an impossibility.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Hospitable People of Volendam</span></p>
</div>
<p>In strange contrast to the smart
Parisian café is the Hotel Spaander in
quaint Volendam, and if it is not the
season you may be alone on the piazza
which is swept by the bracing winds
from the Zuyder Zee, and where the
picturesque hospitable people give you
a cordial greeting. And palatable as
were the marvelous cakes of Paris, they
were no better than the Dutch raisin
bread, Edam cheese and mild beer that
forms your luncheon. Volendam is but
next door to Edam, the home of the
popular cheeses, and the thin shavings
seem to have been made to accompany
the delicious raisin bread of Holland.
The Spaander is a popular rendezvous
for artists, and the big rooms have been
adorned with paintings and sketches
by the men and women who have
enjoyed its hospitality. The bright-faced
girl, who serves you, was taught
to speak English, perhaps, by some
artist who may be a member of the
British Royal Academy now, and she
loves to tell you of the notable people
who have come and gone, and she fairly
carries you away to see the homes of
the fisher folk. She explains their
marvelous clothes, and declares that
the huge silver buttons worn by the
men and boys were used as a mark of
identification in case of drowning, for
each district in Holland has its own
design. She calls your attention to
the old china, pewter and brass, and
giggles approval when you pass the
school and slip a copper into each of
the wooden shoes at the door.</p>

<p>Everybody takes at least one ice at
Florian's on St. Mark's Square in
Venice for at Florian's you are sure
to see the world and his wife, especially,
if you are there on an evening when the
band plays in the square. Florian's
ices are world renowned, and its
patrons are as cosmopolitan as Rumpelmeyer's,
and, as you eat your way
through the pink or chocolate cone of
sweetness, you will find the price of it
in the bottom of the dish. There is no
room for argument over the charge, for
in the bottom of every dish, in plain
figures, is its cost, two francs or two
francs, fifty. And after you have paid
the reckoning, the waiter turns over
the dish as a sign that your debt is
canceled, and you are at liberty to
sit and listen to the music and watch
the people for as long as you wish.</p>

<p>Nearly every European city has a
café or a restaurant that is of special
interest, not because of its smart
patronage or high prices, but for its
quaint customs, old dishes or drinks,
and it varies the routine of galleries
and historic buildings to hunt them
out. They add a spice, a zest, to what
might become rather a dreary round
of sight seeing, for no one appreciates
the old customs more than the American.
There are some travelers who
make a point of stopping at the Three
Tuns in Durham, no more to see Durham's
beautiful cathedral, if the truth
were told, than to have the trim maid
bring them a tiny glass of cherry
brandy to "drink to the health of the
house," a custom that was young two
hundred years or more ago, although it
must be confessed that, while the custom
has been retained, the glasses that
hold the delicious cordial are considerably
smaller than they were in the
days when the request was first made.

<h2 class="p6">Being Married</h2>

<p class="center">By Mrs. Chas. Norman</p>

<p class="p2">The morning paper tells of a man
and woman who got married
after only a few hours' acquaintance.
Unfortunately, this couple cannot
claim to have done anything
unique. Numerous persons have done
likewise&mdash;at least the newspapers say
so&mdash;though the statement is one which
makes upon a sane mind an impression
of confusion. I say confusion, not to
mention other effects.</p>

<p>After reading the announcement, I
looked into the dictionary to see if it
could be true, and I judge it is possible.
Marriage, according to Webster, is the
act which unites the man and woman,
and, while it seems impossible for a real
union to take place in so brief a time,
still there is probably no other way of
telling in the English language what
has occurred. It might well happen
that the persons so hastily "joined"
should become married in the course
of time. Certain metals really mix and
stick together even after the heat of
welding has died out, but no mere
ceremony can unite, though it be performed
by the holiest of ministers or
the most profound legal interpreter.</p>

<p>And, as it is impossible for any third
person to "unite" man and woman,
so it is out of the question for any third
person to give any legitimate advice as
to whether or not the man and woman
should unite, unless by chance the
third person discovers that the real
union or disunion already exists.</p>

<p>An ambitious young lady stopped to
see me on her way to New York.
She was about to sail for Europe, and
she told me, confidentially, that she
was engaged to marry a clergyman of
this country, and that she "might
marry him," if she failed to get a
certain position she hoped for in Paris.</p>

<p>I could not refrain from saying, "Do
not marry," and she took it that I was
either averse to matrimony or to the
young man. Such supposition was incorrect.
I simply disliked to see any
man irrevokably tied to a woman who
took him only because she could not
get something else.</p>

<p>I explained this to the girl, but it
did no good. She said I was "sentimental
and not at all practical." I
confessed to a little sentiment on the
subject of wedlock, and refrained from
adding that I should rather be truthful
than practical, but I told her that, if
she had accepted her lover, conditionally,
her course was entirely honorable,
and then, to relieve the <i>heaviness</i> of the
conversation, I repeated these lines,
which she laughed at very moderately
indeed:</p>

<div class="ctrdblk-container">
<div class="ctrdblk">
<p class="o1">"I, Pegg Pudding, promise thee, William Crickett,</p>
<p>That I will hold thee for mine own dear lily,</p>
<p>Whilst I have a head in mine eye and a face on my nose,</p>
<p>A mouth in my tongue and all that a woman should have,</p>
<p>From the crown of my foot to the sole of my head."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The attention of my guest flagged a
little and, when I completed the stanza,
she confessed she was thinking of a
Philadelphia girl whose resolution she
much admired. During a sojourn in
Europe, this girl had refused sixty-five
offers of marriage&mdash;I hope I have the
number exactly right&mdash;having determined
to marry no one of lower rank
than a prince.</p>

<p>I sped my guest to New York and
Europe, and after her departure no
ghost needed to come from the grave
to tell me why marriage is so often a
failure. We hear this thing and that
thing given as a reason. Responsibility
enough is to be laid at the door of men,
but let women confess a share in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
desecration of the sacred ordinance.
Is it possible to think of a marriage
resulting well that does not begin in
truth, and continue in truth?</p>

<p>Let truth, at least, be counted an
essential. After truth, let the candidate
consider the necessity of sacrifice.
Present-day girls cannot claim much
more of that element than boys. If
modern women have a hobby more
general than another, it must be the
development of their individuality.
This is a fine thing, but let those who
are over-zealous on this point remain
single or remain rational, for it is
scarcely fair to develop one's individuality
to the extinction of another
person's rights. To speak the truth,
a proper individuality is never oblivious
to others. Women would be learned
and wise, but they fail to see that the
very richest return of wisdom comes
from putting forth their full strength
<i>where it is due</i>. God has provided that
recompense for all dutiful activity, and
it often happens that the circumstances
that would seem to retard mental
development are its greatest stimuli,
and the saving of the much-cherished
individuality is accomplished by self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Marriage is one of the apparent interruptions
to intellectual progress&mdash;especially
a woman's. We often hear
of the fine career a certain person
might have had, unmarried. Such talk
signifies nothing.</p>

<p>In the first place, age does not always
fulfill the promises of youth. Many a
young man has started well in life and
failed through no fault of his companion.
A discerning man will not be
apt to choose a frivolous woman,
though we often hear the contrary.
A bright girl, though she may remain
single and devote herself to herself,
is not sure of a successful career.
Some womanly virtues are certainly
fostered best in a home. Love is, to
many women, what the tropics are to
vegetation. On the other hand, there
are women who seem to be created for
public benefactions and isolated labors.</p>

<p>Concentration in any line of business
is bound to bring definite results, but
definite, tangible results may not be
the best results. A man who assumes
some domestic responsibility must
abridge his public services, and, as it
is only public services that make a
show, his life seems less valuable.</p>

<p>"I like you better since you married,"
said a frank old lady to a young man,
and he laughed and answered:</p>

<p>"I used to know a great many things,
but they were all wrong, every one of
them! It takes a sensible wife to
straighten out a man's mental distortions."
Doubtless his wife could
have reversed the compliment.</p>

<p>The pictures of unhappy marriages
are hung in every household which the
American press can possibly reach:
the good marriages attract no attention.
Natural reverence prevents those
who know anything about them from
telling what they know. We do not
talk glibly of God's love. The theme
is sacred. Just as sacred, and very
personal, is the other subject. No man
of sense, who loves his wife, says much
about it, even to his intimate friends.
What adult, with reason, goes about
seeking advice upon matrimony?</p>

<p>Marriage is for persons of mature
minds, and it is absolutely an individual
matter, each case deciding
itself. Let those who doubt concerning
matrimony stay out of it. Let those
who are already in it, remember that
it is a solemn compact between two
persons and that any action is unbecoming
and inconsistent which does
not result to the advantage of both.

<h2 class="p6">The Regeneration of Podunk</h2>

<p class="center">By Ph&oelig;be D. Roulon</p>

<p class="p2">Jack and I arrived at Podunk
just in "strawberry time." Did
you ever stop to consider what a
mandatory phrase "strawberry time"
is? Jack and I did to the fullest, for
from one end of Podunk highway to
the other, in every farmstead that was
the happy possessor of a strawberry
patch, the proclamation had gone
forth that berries were ripe and must
be "done up" at once. There is no
such thing as procrastinating with
Nature, especially in her fruit department.
Infinite in patience, unsparing
in pains from the first inception of the
berry to its maturity, when once her
creative work is accomplished, she
lays the finished product at your feet
and henceforth waives all responsibility.
Put off until tomorrow what
should have been "done up" today
and Nature will seek vengeance upon
you and show you your folly. Mrs.
Simpkins might better save her breath
than to enter the protest that she
cannot possibly "can" today, for the
minister and family are coming to
dinner. Nature makes no exception
for even the clergy. When Mrs. Hopewell
declares she must take her butter
and eggs to market today and so cannot
do another stroke of work after
one o'clock, Nature simply smiles
complacently from the four corners
of every ruddy berry basket and says,
"Take me now in my perfection, for
tomorrow it will have passed away."</p>

<p>In obedience to this inexorable law
Podunk was making ready. Brass
kettles were being scoured and granite
ones were coming forth from their
winter hiding places. With one accord
Podunk was becoming a huge canning
and preserving factory, with as many
annexes as there were houses with
berry patches.</p>

<p>Day after day the process went on,
for day after day a fresh supply demanded
attention.</p>

<p>Overworked and tired housewives
groaned in spirit and slept in meeting
as a result. Everybody's nerves were
a little on the bias until the strawberries
were settled for the winter. To
a casual observer it seemed as if
Nature's lavishness had outrun Podunk's
gratitude, and as if strawberries
were becoming a nuisance.</p>

<p>As I said, Jack and I arrived just at
this crisis in the farm life of Podunk.
Indeed, within an hour after we landed,
and amid the chaos of unpacking, a
gentle maiden tapped at our kitchen
door and importuned us to buy some
preserving berries.</p>

<p>Jack has a sweet tooth and I saw
at a glance that he had not missed the
vision of rows of red jars on the swinging
shelf in the cellar, and Sunday
night teas of jam, long after the last
strawberry had ripened and decayed.
But he desisted and let her depart
without buying a berry. This I call
heroic and manly, and told him so on
the spot.</p>

<p>Of course the well had not been
pumped out, the water-pail had not
been unpacked, the grocery supplies
had not arrived. There had not been
a fire in the stove for eight months,
and there was no split wood in the
wood shed, but men have been known
to expect household routine to go on
under conditions quite as hindering,
therefore I repeat, that Jack, in the face
of vanishing sweets, showed fortitude
and consideration.</p>

<p>But it was plain that "strawberry
time" had made an impression on his
mind that took somewhat the form of
a problem.</p>

<p>Now Jack is never happier than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
when he has nuts to crack or problems
to solve. He is that all-round type of
man that can and does bring the same
philosophic trend of mind to bear
upon matters domestic as upon civic
and national affairs.</p>

<p>We had come to Podunk to rest, but
Jack always rests in motion, and in
less than a week after our arrival I saw
him go forth to canvass the community.
For days and days he was as glum as
an oyster, leaving me to guess what he
was up to, but I have so long known
the limitations to his capacity for holding
in and carrying a secret, that I
could wait in patience for the unbosoming.
It came on one of those
chilly, rainy nights in June,&mdash;the sort
of night that Jack always expects and
gets warm gingerbread for supper.
Gingerbread always puts him in a
talkative mood.</p>

<p>We had each taken a second cup of
tea, when Jack looked up and said,
"Do you realize, my dear, that this
canning and jellying process is only
just started for the season in Podunk?
I find that our Fourth of July not only
proclaims American independence but
also the proper time for making currant
jelly, and so, unless Nature plays us
false, the same ordeal must be repeated,
with only the difference that 'currant'
will be written on the label instead of
'strawberry.' And still another repetition,
when raspberries are ripe and
blackberries grow sweet and luscious.
Again when the huckleberry bushes
give up their treasures, shadowing
forth a winter supply for pies. Then
come the peaches, pears and plums,
followed by apples, grapes and quinces.
Between times, lest the hand forgets its
cunning, there are peas, corn, beets and
tomatoes to be rescued for future use.
And the season ends with a pickling
tournament.</p>

<p>"It hardly seems creditable, but
from here to Podunk Hollow, a distance
of less than two miles, and only sparsely
settled, I find by actual count that
there are thousands of cans of fruit
and hundreds of glasses of jelly prepared
every season. From 'strawberry
time'&mdash;indeed some ambitious
housekeepers start in with rhubarb in
April&mdash;until the last luckless green
tomato is snatched from Jack Frost,
there is a mad rush on the part of the
farmer's wife to keep apace with
Nature and to take care of her bounties
with a thrifty hand."</p>

<p>By this time Jack was ready for a
second helping of gingerbread and proceeded.
"Don't you see, my dear, that
this is an awful waste of muscular
energy and stove fuel. Don't you see
that consolidation and coöperation at
just this point would emancipate these
women quite as much as the telephone
and the rural delivery?</p>

<p>"Furthermore, I believe there is
fruit enough that goes to waste every
year, which, if rescued, would not only
pay for the running of a community
kitchen, but also give a handsome
bonus for civic beautifying. It is my
firm faith that Podunk can earn the
foundations of a fine library, within the
next three years, by simply saving the
waste of fruit and vegetables within her
own borders. She has a market already
established at the summer colony
of Bide-a-wee."</p>

<p>The third piece of gingerbread gave
Jack the courage to make a clean breast
of everything, and to confess that he had
called a meeting and made all the
necessary arrangements to start a community
kitchen for canning and preserving,
to be ready this season for the
currant crop.</p>

<p>Jack always persists that my impulsive
opposition is his most helpful
ally, so I never feel hindered in giving
it. But I said "You have surely never
looked at this problem from the psychological
standpoint. You have never
calculated the personal pride of every
housewife in her own handiwork, done
in her own way, the way tradition has
made sacred to her. Eliminate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
personal touch from half the preserve
closets of Podunk and you rob them of
their glory and half of their flavor.
There are some things that cannot be
consolidated and coöperated and this
is one of them. Why! Mrs. Patterson
would be inconsolably wretched, if she
thought a jar of peaches would ever
stand in her cellar that did not adhere
to the formula of one and three-quarters
pints of sugar to three pints of water.
Now Mrs. Smith is equally loyal to one
and one-half parts sugar to three parts
water."</p>

<p>"And as for jelly making, it has a
hedge about it as conservative and invulnerable
as a Chinese wall. Instance,
our beloved Mrs. Thornton. That
splendid spirit of housewifely excellence
that we have always admired in her
would be wholly inundated and wrecked,
if she ever had to set before us, on her
own tea-table, a glass of jelly that had
been made by heating the currants
before they were crushed, and straining
the juice through cheesecloth instead of
flannel. To Mrs. Thornton there is
but one right way, the cold and flannel
process.</p>

<p>"Even I, Jack, dear, must own up
to feeling an unpleasant sensation
down my spinal column, and a vexatious
agitation in my mind, whenever I see
jelly boil more than five minutes after
the sugar is added. Nay, my Worthy
Wisdom, let me entreat you to carefully
consider ere you intrude upon the
sacred precincts of jelly-making with
any ruthless tread.</p>

<p>"As for pickling, it is an established
fact that every housewife pickles to
suit the taste of her family and her rule
lies in the palate of said family. You
know that the Joneses are always strong
on the onion flavor, while the Millers
emphasize cinnamon and allspice!
Fancy consolidating these flavors into
a blend and expect either family to be
contented and happy.</p>

<p>"Worthy as your Community
Kitchen idea is in its inception, I fear it
is doomed to failure. It uproots too
many of the 'eternals' of housekeeping."</p>

<p>Jack received my volley of opposing
arguments, not only with fortitude
but with apparent satisfaction, and
simply said, "Have you finished?"
As I had, he again took the floor.</p>

<p>"Now, I am sure that my foundation
is secure and my psychological attitude
all right, for all the objections you
mention were brought up, in one form
or another, at the meeting we held, and
I was able to meet every one of them.
No, my dear, I do not mean to uproot
the 'eternals' and the Joneses shall
stand for onion flavor to the end of
time. The personal equation will always
be considered. Each farmer will
simply send his consignment of berries
or fruit with explicit instructions as
to recipes to be followed, just as our
great-grandfathers sent their grist to
the mill to be ground and ordered
middlings left in or middlings left out,
according as to whether it was for
pancakes or bread. Those worthies
took it on faith that they brought back
the same grain they carried and there
need be no question now. Farmer
Dunn's marrowfats need never get
mixed with Deacon White's telephone
peas, and Mrs. Thornton can always
send her flannel jelly bag.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion that the good
wives will have gained enough leisure
time to come to the Kitchen and inspect
the process while their batch of
fruit is being handled."</p>

<p>So closely are faith and works related
in Jack's philosophy of life that
in an incredibly short time Podunk
awoke one morning to find the abandoned
Haskell house turned into a
"Community Kitchen," in charge of a
New England man and his wife, of
thrift and learning. They began on
the currant crop.</p>

<p>Of course, since Jack was behind the
innovation, I had to show my faith
by sending the first lot, with instructions
that the jelly should be boiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
only one minute after the sugar was
added. The twenty glasses of tender
crystalline jelly that stood on my
pantry shelf the next day needed no
argument and so encouraged my nearest
neighbor that she sent half of her picking
to the Kitchen. I saw that it
caused a wrench, but she supported
herself on the consciousness that she
was only risking half. But the jelly
that came back adhered so closely in
color, taste and texture to the "traditional"
that the other half was sent
without a qualm. This made a beginning
and by the time the raspberries
were ripe a dozen families were converted.</p>

<p>When the fall fruits came on, it had
grown into such a fashion to send the
preserving out that the capacity of
the Kitchen was somewhat taxed.
An evaporating outfit was added, that
saved hundreds of bushels of apples
from absolute waste. A simple device
for making unfermented grape
juice brought profit enough the first
year to paint the town hall, build over
the stage and buy a curtain that never
failed to work.</p>

<p>The second year a "Sunshine"
Laundry was added to the Kitchen,
which proved a great boon. Podunk
had wrestled with the domestic problem,
but like the rest of the world had not
solved it, and was left to do its own
washing.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the "Community
Kitchen" was established on
a coöperative basis, with the understanding
that after all running expenses
were paid and each contributor
had a certain share of profit,
proportioned to the amount of surplus
material he contributed, all the remaining
profit was to go for the improvement
of the town.</p>

<p>The "Kitchen" is now three years
old and every visitor coming to Podunk
naturally wanders into the pretty new
library on Main Street. The sweet-faced
librarian is always cordial and
tells you with unmasked pride that
this is the first library built of fruit and
vegetables.</p>

<p>But complete regeneration came not
to Podunk, until the Culture Club became
an active organization, impelled
forward by the brain force of the women
of the community. Given a margin of
leisure, it was demonstrated that culture
will flourish as persistently in rural
districts as in city precincts. Shakespeare
and Browning were not neglected,
nor were Wagner and Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>Nature study, Domestic Economy
and Civic beautifying opened new and
broad avenues of culture, and classes
in these subjects were held every week.
The women of Podunk began to know
their birds and to call them by name.
The church suppers took on a new
aspect, for the dietetic unrighteousness
of four kinds of cake and three kinds
of sweet pudding, at the same meal,
was openly discussed and frowned
upon. Deacon Wyburn, who had a
tooth sweeter even than Jack's, declared,
at first, that this was heresy that
should not be allowed to enter the
sanctuary. But regeneration came
to the deacon as indigestion departed.</p>

<p>And all of this happened, because
Jack saw the need of an emancipation
proclamation and the people of Podunk
availed themselves of its freedom.
I have always said that Jack was a man
among men.</p>

<h2 class="p6">Out of Chicken Pie</h2>

<p class="center">By Helen Campbell</p>

<p class="p2">"The point is," said the young
woman, "never to spend any
time in self-pity and never
mention one of whatever afflictions may
have been apportioned to your individual
self. The first takes your
strength and spoils any good work you
might do. The second is a bore to your
friends and destruction to self-respect.
In the first grip of things it is possible
one may send up a howl. But at that
or any other time, no matter what the
impulse, Don't!"</p>

<p>Was she a young woman after all?
For, as she brought out the "Don't!"
staccato, I looked again. Really she
seemed more like a nice boy, well up
in athletics, and as far on in general
college work as athletics permit. Her
hair was short, cut close to her head,
yet curly, and though rather a dark
brown, yet showing gold where little
tendrils had their way, here and there,
behind an ear or on her slender neck.
Her hands were small, of course, for
she was a Southern woman, generations
of whom had no need to use their
hands in any coarsening work, yet
could and did use them in delicate
cookery, preserving, and the like, and
knew every secret of cutting and
generally overseeing the garments for
a plantation. Delicately formed,
straight as a dart and with the alert
expression of a champion tennis player,
she stood at the gate into the chicken-yard,
and smiled a delightful smile.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't tell you one word,"
she said, "if you hadn't come from so
old a friend. Oh, privately I would
tell anyone interested, but printing is
another matter. It will help, you say.
I'm sure I don't know. Perhaps, but
I somehow seem to think most find
out for themselves, perhaps by a good
many experiments, just what to do.
But I will tell you just how it began
with me. Nellie has told you, I don't
doubt, that I was left a widow with
three children. We had lived in town,
after my marriage, in a rented house.
When my husband died and I presently
summed up my capital, it was, first, the
children, then, not quite two hundred
dollars left in the bank after the expenses
of the long sickness and the
funeral were paid. Added to this were
nine hens and a rooster that I had kept
at the end of the little garden at the
back of the house, our cat and dog and
about a fortnight's supplies in the
pantry. Our clothes, too, were in fair
amount and order. That was all.
Lots of people came to condole with
me and tell me what to do, but not
one made what seemed to me a really
practical suggestion. I knew what I
could do, or thought I did, which
amounts to the same thing, if you
really go ahead and do it. I did it.</p>

<p>"The first thing was to move into the
country, where I had longed to have
the children. It isn't country now
exactly, for the station is not far away,
but the house was out of repair, and
I had the option of buying it at the
end of the year, if I wanted it then.
The owner couldn't do much and was
glad to think it might be off his hands,
and I took it for eighty dollars a year&mdash;this
to include a few repairs.</p>

<p>"There was a big garden, not tended
for years, not a fruit tree, and the four
acres outside the fenced-in garden one
mass of brush. My next neighbor was
a farmer from the North, come South
for his health and getting it, and he
took an interest from the beginning;
he ploughed my land for me, and
agreed to go over it with the cultivator
when it was necessary, but I must first
manage to rake up and burn up all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the weeds and sticks, etc. The children
helped me and we made a spree of it.
I bought a cow of him, a good one, and,
as one of my hens had begun to set on
a box of nails, decided she should have
eggs. He had some fine, pure-blooded
Plymouth Rocks, and mine were Wyandottes,
just as good and no fear as to
crossing breeds, and so I started in.
What I was after was broilers, and if
broilers wouldn't support us, why
there was something else that I felt
sure would, and that was chicken pies.
You smile, but let me tell you they
weren't everyday chicken pies. Our
old Dilly on my father's plantation
was a champion chicken-pie maker,
in demand for every wedding and
general church entertainment, and she
taught me just how, swearing me to
secrecy long as she lived. So I watched
her many times, realizing, at last, that
it meant using the very choicest
material straight through. No old
hens simmered all day long to make
them tender. On the contrary, she demanded
the choicest broilers, and she
made, not exactly puff paste but the
most delicate order of pastry to put
them in. To season to a turn and with
no variation, and to have the gravy
smooth and rich, these were her secrets,
and I learned them so thoroughly that
after once sampling them there was
no further trouble as to orders. I sent
little individual pies to every hotel
and restaurant in the city I had left.
I had bought a good cow, as I said, and
soon bought another, to have plenty of
cream, for that was one important item
in the pies, and as the work got too
much for me alone I presently had a
girl to help, and at last another, all of
us doing steady hard work, but liking
it. I raised the chickens, you see,
though I often hated to have them
killed, and by this time we had small
fruits, and all that grows in a well-kept
garden. The children helped as
well as went to school and were rosy,
healthy creatures, my comfort and
joy, and they always have been. I
never have cleared over five hundred
a year, but what more do I need? I
make ten cents clear on each individual
chicken pie and fifteen on the
larger ones. Specials I make as large
as people want them, but I prefer the
little ones. Three sizes are made every
day, and some families, who go away
for the summer, have their chicken pies
expressed to them each week and
won't do without them. Some people
fuss and say they are too rich. Others
want me to charge less and say, if I
would use lard instead of butter in
the pastry, I could sell cheaper. But
I answer that it is my business never
to fall below the standard. Aunt Dilly
would turn in her grave if she thought
her rule was to have lard used instead
of butter. I made some experiments
and found it was distinctly best to
stick close to the old original text.
You can buy cheap pies anywhere
and they taste cheap. These melt in
your mouth. And you ought to know
that two other women in the neighborhood
have specialties, too, and I taught
them, for my mother used to make a
delicious chicken jelly for sick people
and one woman does that and has a big
market for it at the Woman's Exchange,
and another makes cornbeef hash for
three restaurants and has all she can
do. The gist of it is <i>good cooking can
always be made to pay</i>. Keep to the
best form you can find, never vary,
and a living, and often much more, is
certain. When women learn that,
perhaps more of them will turn in this
direction. Here is the home paid for,
trees growing and yielding, children
growing too, and Tom almost ready for
college, and chicken pie has done it,
and will keep on doing it, perhaps as
long as I live. At any rate I should
never stop doing something as perfectly
as I could for that is half the fun
of living. Don't you think so? We
keep the evenings for as much of a
good time as possible. I keep a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of my old music and play accompaniments,
for Tom has a fine baritone
voice and we all sing, and Edith and
her violin take the kinks out of any
day's work. We have a fair little
library and do not mean to fall behind
or forget what quiet progress means.
It has been a happy life, thank God!
How could it help being so, with such
children and a certain sure thing to do?"</p>

<p>Yes, how could it help being thus
with such a spirit at work to bring it
about? That was the thought as I
looked at the mother, and wished that
all dolorous and uncertain women
might have the same chance. Joining
the Sunshine Circle or the Harmony
Club might be the first essential. After
that things would take care of themselves.</p>

<h2 class="p6">Old Age</h2>

<p class="center">By Kate Gannett Wells</p>

<p class="p2">Old age becomes more of a problem
when living in it than when
viewed afar off. It is a question
of economics and ethics more than of
wrinkles. It is so easy not to mind it
when well, rich and beloved; it is so
impossible not to object to it when
sick, poor and unwelcome. It creeps
into almost every home and, though
we try to alleviate it and succeed to a
certain extent, through affection, cookery
and cleanliness, the vast majority
of the world does not know how to
manage to live on almost nothing, and
yet it is upon those of small or of no
means that the support of old age
presses most heavily. So love only is
left, and too often not even that.</p>

<p>Then one wonders if one ought to
refuse marriage and devote one's self
to one's parents;&mdash;or, if married and
children are many, and food and lodgings
scant, shall one also house one's
aged parents? If the ethics thereof
are difficult to settle when money and
space are available, it is a hideous task
for decision when both are lacking.</p>

<p>Nowhere does the attempted settlement
to remove the stigma of pauperism
from the aged through legislation
threaten to be more puzzling than in
England, where after January 1, 1911,
a workhouse inmate of above seventy
years and "fairly respectable" is entitled
to leave the house and receive
in lieu of its shelter five shillings a week.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Is acceptance of such pension outside
of a workhouse more honorable than
being dependent on Government for
support inside the workhouse? That
is the question the Old Age pensioners
of England are trying to solve. Who
is going to house, feed and clothe them
for five shillings a week? What does
that amount to, set against the care
of an infirm, old, undesired relative
who is not wanted either for his keep
or his affection, and who will only grow
older? Even as a boarder of no kin
whatever to his landlady, is he likely
to be as comfortable as in the workhouse?
Startling have been some of
the discoveries that have followed upon
this apparently beneficent legislation.</p>

<p>Well was it that Miss Edith Sellers
of England, of her own free will, visited
relatives of the inmates of a London
workhouse, hoping to carry back to the
latter place the joyful tidings that they
were wanted in families. Alas! out of
528 such inmates only 221 had any
relatives, and more than half of that
number knew that, if they went to their
kinspeople, they would not be taken in.
Some who had felt sure of a welcome
were bitterly disappointed. "Old folk
give no end of trouble; keeping them
clean takes up all one's time. Besides
they must have somewhere to sleep,"
was generally answered. One grown-up
daughter, supporting herself, her
mother and brother in two rooms, one
no better than a cupboard, grieved she
could not take back her father. Other
sons and daughters, by blood or by
law, waxed indignant at being urged
to receive their kinsmen, even for the
sake of the shillings. They had neither
room nor food for them; each generation
must care first for its own children
and not take up burdens of parents,
worse still of grandparents, aunts and
cousins once gotten rid of; especially,
if they were of the drunken variety,
as was too often the case.</p>

<p>Fortunately Miss Sellers found a few
other homes which promised to receive
a pensioner for the sake of his pension,
or from real affection. After all the
bitter work-a-day life in these narrow
homes, attics, cellars, two or three
rooms at most, would have been more
wretched for the pensioners to bear
than their blighted hopes. "To work
a bit harder," in order to take in one's
aged mother, is not possible in thousands
of cases. Better to remain a workhouse
pauper and be sure of warmth,
cleanliness and food than to wander
forth uncared for or to be an unwelcome
burden on an overworked child.</p>

<p>Therefore is it that the English Old
Age Pension Act does not solve its own
problem, for the infirm or sick must
still be sheltered in some refuge which
should have no workhouse taint of
pauperism attached to it.</p>

<p>However much there may be among
us of similar reluctance to take home
aged pauper relatives, it has not yet
become a matter of public investigation,
though, if it were, it is possible that
there would be as much unwillingness
manifested here as in England. Certainly
many of our almshouses and
homes for the aged poor suggest that
there will be the same forlorn hopes
shattered, if pensions should ever be
conferred instead of legal residences
in almshouses.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, old age is still an
individual question. All the more,
then, should elderly people not let
themselves get crabbed. Of course,
if other people would not nag one with
being old, one would not be,&mdash;quite
so old!</p>

<p>What old age, whether poor, middling
or well-to-do lacks is amusement.
It is lonesome to keep jolly by remembering
that one's mind ought to
be one's kingdom. Meditation is all
very well, but so also is the circus,
the "greatest value of which lies in its
non-ethical quality." Even if it has
its symbolism, it does not mercilessly
set one to moralizing, save as a three
ring circus and a "brigade of clowns"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
(the result of trying to make as much
money as possible) incites to weariness.
The real "gospel of the circus" lies in
its democracy, in its revealings of the
power of training on acrobats and
animals through kindly persistence, and
in the mutual good will and law abiding
qualities of the household of a
circus. Always has it belonged to the
people, and even ministers have
not been discounted for their
attendance.</p>

<p>It seems a wide jump in fancy from
old age to a circus, and yet to me they
are intimately connected through the
dear old people, poor and well to do,
whom I have known, who found in it
their objective base for amusement.
To them the clown and his jokes were
links in the spirit of human brotherhood.
Alas, as a pension of five shillings
a week will not permit of the
circus in its glory, old age asks for the
minor blessings of five cent shows,
public parks, and good tobacco. Just
to be out doors is rejuvenating.</p>

<p>All the more is amusement desirable,
because legislation has undertaken to
set the goal when one shall no longer
work. To retire teachers, officers,
workers, merely because they are sixty-five
or seventy is an insult to human
nature, which rejects any arbitrary
limit save that of incapacity. The
average of average people, though perhaps
unable to earn their living after
seventy, are still capable of being occupied.
Therefore let the old folks
work at household and woodshed
drudgery as long as they can, however
irritating their slowness may be to the
young and merciless. Let the old
serve also in semi-public ways, because
of their experience, even if they are
not wanted round.</p>

<p>It is a common saying that it is
harder to resign office at seventy than
at sixty, just because old age clings to
occupation as its protection. But if
with most of us, if not with all, as the
years increase, occupation shrivels and
the fads or hobbies, the solace of earlier
days, cease by their very weight to be
pursued,&mdash;then may there still be
amusement provided for the elderly
before they become "Shut Ins," dependent
on Christmas and Easter cards
for enjoyment.</p>

<h2 class="p6">Three Girls go Blackberrying</h2>

<p class="center">By Samuel Smyth</p>

<p class="p2">Grandpa told Mary that he
saw a few blackberries in the
pasture. Mary hastened to inform
Mina that there were bushels of
ripe blackberries in the pasture. Mina
hurried to tell Jane, and almost breathlessly
suggested that they go and get
them before anybody else found them.
Jane thought it would be more comfortable
after sundown. Mina said that
they would be gone before that time,
and insisted that they go at once.
Outnumbered, Jane reluctantly consented.
Mary must change her dress;
so must the other two. Much time was
spent in that operation, for it included
the special dressing of the hair, also.
There was much impatience manifested
by Mary, the first to declare herself
ready; but after the others appeared
she suddenly thought of several things
that she must attend to. At last each
inquired of the others, "Well, are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a minute," said Mina. "I
forgot to put on cold cream to prevent
sunburn."</p>

<p>"So did I," said Jane; "and, Mary,
you had better use some, also, or you
will regret it."</p>

<p>"I think I will," said Mary; and a
good half hour has passed before they
are all downstairs again, when the old
question was asked again, "Are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"Had we better wear rubbers?"
asked Jane.</p>

<p>"No," answered Mary, "but I am
going upstairs to put on an old pair of
shoes."</p>

<p>"That is sensible," said Mina. "I
think we all had better follow Mary's
example, as it won't take a minute."</p>

<p>Upstairs they all went again; much
talk and another half hour passed
when each made the declaration, "Well,
I am ready, are you?" with much emphasis
on the personal pronoun I.</p>

<p>"Are you coming with me?" said
Mary, and she started in the direction
of the pasture with great animation,
when Jane inquired, in a loud voice, if
she were not going to take something
along to put the berries in.</p>

<p>"To be sure I am. In my hurry I
entirely forgot it. What shall I take?"
asked Mary.</p>

<p>"We ourselves have not yet decided.
Which do you think would be better,
Mary, a basket or a pail?"</p>

<p>"I don't know and I don't care what
you take, I am going to take a paper
bag," replied Mary. "It is light and
convenient, and we can easily destroy
all evidence of failure in case we fail
to get any berries."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mary, for the happy
suggestion. We will take paper bags.
What size will be suitable?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Jane, "that if we
each fill a flour sack, that will be sufficient
for once. It is such a job to
carry so many or to make them into
jam."</p>

<p>"To obviate any chance for envy as
to which shall gather the greatest
amount of berries, let us take along a
common, large receptacle, into which
each of us shall deposit as often as our
smaller vessels shall be filled."</p>

<p>"That is a thoughtful and wise plan
for an unambitious person. I assent
to the proposition," smilingly answered
Mina.</p>

<p>A bushel basket was found and all
agreed to take turns in carrying it to
the pasture. At last, the procession
was formed, after several more short
halts for consultation and criticism,
and was finally under way for the
pasture. But when in the highway,
which they had to cross to reach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
same, they were accosted by two
ragged boys with, "Say, girls, do you
want to buy any berries; only five cents
a quart; twelve quarts&mdash;all there were
in the pasture, every one, and it's the
last picking of the season."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I told you so; I knew
it would be this way," said Mary
petulantly; "some people are so
slow."</p>

<p>"It is too provoking for anything,"
said Mina, "and it will be so humiliating
to return to the house without any
berries after making such a hullabaloo,"
sighed Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh, girls!" exclaimed Mary, "let's
buy the berries of the boys and divide
them between us. Let's see, twelve
divided by three equals four; four
quarts is a very reasonable and respectable
amount for an ordinary person.
You hold them while I run home and
get the money."</p>

<p>After the transfer of the berries was
completed, the three girls returned to
the house, triumphantly smiling, and
happy, with the twelve quarts of
berries. Mingling with the rest of the
family, I could not refrain from speaking
about what fun it was to go berrying,
when suddenly grandpa remarked,
"that four quarts was a very reasonable
and respectable amount for an
ordinary person." Grandpa had been
sitting on a fence, concealed by bushes,
and had seen the whole performance.</p>

<p>A quick, suspicious, comprehensive
glance passed between the conspirators,
when the suspense was broken
by the voice of the shock-headed boy
who yelled out, "Say, girls, do you
want to buy any more berries for
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"How provoking!" said Mary.</p>

<p>"How humiliating!" assented Mina.</p>

<p>"I feel so ashamed I shall never
feel right again. Why did we dissemble?
Prevarication is a kind of a
lie; I never want to hear the word
'blackberries' again," moaned Jane.</p>

<p class="center p4">"WHERE THERE IS NO VISION,
THE PEOPLE PERISH."</p>

<p>Often life becomes dull and
irksome because our living and
working seem to be in vain.
We are constantly asking ourselves,
how we can make our lives worth
living. Now, in accordance with the
consensus of modern thought, it would
seem that the better way to live is,
while ever taking active interest in the
current affairs of the day, to cherish
some lofty aim or purpose, in other
words, "to formulate and cultivate a
vision."</p>

<p>A vision is the aim, purpose, object
or ideal we set before us in our several
occupations in life. As we find it
stated elsewhere, "A vision, a creative
vision, is a pictured goal. There is
purpose and vigor in it. It is productive
of results, and the loftier the
vision, the higher the attainment."</p>

<p>In life and history it is easy to distinguish
the man of vision from him
who is without high aim. "Eat, drink
and be merry" is the maxim of the
one, while faithful service in trying to
make the conditions of life better, far
and wide, is characteristic of the other.
Likewise, the nature or quality of every
man's vision is capable of discernment.
Certainly no aim or low aim is almost
crime.</p>

<p>Each of us must find his vision in
his own occupation or calling in life.
There each must strive not only to
grow and enrich his own life, but also
that of the few or the many about him,
as chance or environment permits.</p>

<div class="ctrdblk-container">
<div class="ctrdblk">
<p class="o1">"Not for success, nor health, nor wealth, nor fame,</p>
<p>I daily beg on bended knee from Thee;</p>
<p>But for Thy guidance. Make my life so fit</p>
<p>That ne'er in condemnation must I sit,</p>
<p>Judged by the clear-eyed children Thou gav'st me."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To the home-maker, for instance,
with an ideal like this, life cannot seem
listless and futile, nor of such an one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
can it be said that her life has been
lived in vain.</p>

<p>Does it not follow that the only life
worth living is that which is actuated
by a real purpose, a lofty ideal, a clear
vision? How much in the way of
successful and happy living depends
upon our ideals! Let us look well to
<i>our aims</i>; waste no time in idle dreaming,
but keep ever before us some far-away
and hopeful vision.</p>

<p class="center p4">PROGRESS AND REFORM</p>

<p>We believe that progress is made
by means of genuine reform.
In every instance we find
ourselves on the side of wholesome
reform, for in this way only true
progress seems to lie. The changes
that have taken place within the past
fifty years in our educational system
are great, indeed. No doubt these
changes have been beneficial in the
main, and yet further changes are still
needful. Certainly, according to recent
developments, some change seems to
be called for in our reformatory institutions.</p>

<p>In general, it seems to us the transition
from our schools and colleges to
the imperative duties and occupations
of life is too abrupt, too difficult and
sadly unsatisfactory; at least this is
true in case of the majority of young
people. Education should prepare one
to pass easily and readily into some
chosen occupation, and the first need
of every human being is the chance to
earn a living; since every one should
earn his bread by the sweat of his
brow. Do our schools fit or unfit our
youth for life's real work? Can they
engage at once and successfully in
some congenial occupation? Until
these questions can be favorably
answered, we advocate reform in our
forms of education. Labor we must;
a taste, even a fondness for wholesome,
necessary labor should be cultivated
in our schools.</p>

<p>It has been stated and confirmed by
those in authority that $300,000,000
might be saved per year in the conduct
of our government on a strictly
business basis. If this be true, here
reform, good and true, is an imperative
need. Such a condition of affairs
is in no sense humorous. For what do
we choose our legislators? Is it to
squander or conserve the revenues and
resources of the State?</p>

<p>Likewise, in ways of living or the
conduct of life, reform is ever in order,
provided thereby gain can be made.
It has been said that "The whole moral
law is based on health. The ideal body
is the proper shrine for the ideal soul,&mdash;a
truth that has yet to be educated
into the modern consciousness. Righteousness
and health should go together.
This is an eternal law,&mdash;a law that
covers society, education and morality.
The real meaning of the word 'temperance'
is a careful use of the body. It
has nothing primarily to do with mere
abstinence from certain forms of pleasure.
A man says to himself, I am in
possession of a mechanism which will
endure a certain amount of wear and
usage, but it is the most delicate of
all machinery, and for that reason it
must be used with more consideration
than even the fine works of a watch.
Intemperance, of any sort, means
unnecessary wear and tear. It increases
the waste of the system, the
rapidity of the living process, so that
repair cannot keep up with use, and
it burns where there should be the
clear light of life."</p>

<p class="center p4">DON'T KILL THE BIRDS</p>

<p>For a number of years the scientific
investigators have been
arguing that a bird&mdash;almost any
bird&mdash;was worth a good deal more to
the country alive than dead; worth
more in the glorious freedom of its
habitat than on my lady's hat or on
the plate of the epicure. It has been
shown by the dissection of birds and the
examination of their stomachs just what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
seeds and insects they eat. These examinations
have made it clear that most
birds live principally on the seeds of
pernicious weeds, and on the insect
and small mammal pests against which
the farmer has to wage an increasing
fight every year. It is true that some
birds damage crops and it is true that
any birds will do damage if there are
too many of them&mdash;just as the extreme
congestion of people results in disease
and immorality. But under normal
conditions of distribution almost any
bird is an able assistant to the agriculturist
and horticulturist in the protection
of his crops against their most
dangerous enemies.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>The steady increase in the cost of
living during the period of a year and
a half ending on the last day of March,
1910, is strikingly demonstrated by a
bulletin issued by the Bureau of Labor
of the Department of Commerce and
Labor. It is shown by the careful
investigation into the course of prices
of 257 commodities, which enter into
the everyday life of the average man,
that prices last March were higher
than at any time since twenty years
ago; that in that month it cost the
consumer 7.5 per cent more to buy
the necessities of life than it had cost
him in March, 1909; 10.2 per cent more
than in August, 1908; 21.1 per cent
more than the average range of prices
for 1900; 49.2 per cent more than in
1897,&mdash;a rate of progression which is
causing a country-wide agitation for
means and measures of relief. Yet it
is shown that prices in 1909, high as
they were, still ranged 2.3 per cent
below those for 1907, the costliest year
in the period beginning with 1890.</p>

<p class="center p4">ECONOMY, WISE AND UNWISE</p>

<p>We are trying to publish a
magazine in every sense worth
renewing. That we are succeeding
to a certain degree is shown
by the increasing number of our
readers who are renewing their annual
subscriptions, and calling for back
numbers, in order to bind their volumes
and keep them in permanent form for
future reference and use.</p>

<p>Not long since we shipped to Calcutta,
India, back numbers, to complete
a full set of fourteen volumes,
up to date. A woman who seems to
have no special need of the magazine
wrote recently, "I am sending my
renewal because it seems to me the
magazine is entirely too good a publication
not to be found in every good
home."</p>

<p>Though the cost of living at present
is high, we hope no good, earnest

<h2 class="p6">A Lift for Every Day</h2>

<p>Lincoln's rules for living: "Don't
worry, eat three good meals a day,
say your prayers, be courteous to
your creditors, keep your digestion
good, steer clear of biliousness, exercise,
go slow and go easy. Maybe
there are other things that your special
case requires to make you happy, but,
my friend, these, I reckon, will give
you a good lift."</p>

<p>"This cook-book will do very nicely,"
said Mrs. Nuwedd to the book department
clerk; "and now I want a good,
standard work on taxidermy." "We
don't keep any in stock," said the clerk.
"How annoying!" sighed the young
housewife, "and I not knowing a
blessed thing about stuffing a fowl!"

<h2 class="p2">Seasonable Recipes</h2>

<p class="center">By Janet M. Hill</p>

<p class="p2">In all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting
once. When flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful
is meant. A tablespoonful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a <i>level</i> spoonful
of such material.</p>

<h3>Clam Broth, Chantilly Style</h3>

<p>This most refreshing broth may
be served hot or cold. Canned
broth may be used, or, when
fresh clams are obtainable, the broth
may be fresh made from either clams
in bulk or in the shells. For clams in
bulk, to serve eight, take one pint of
fresh opened clams, two stalks of
celery, broken in pieces, and one quart
of cold water. Bring the whole slowly
to the boiling point and let boil five
minutes. Skim carefully as soon as
the boiling point is reached. Strain
through a napkin wrung out of boiling
water. Season with salt, if needed;
add also a little paprika or other pepper.
Beat one cup of double cream until
firm throughout. Set a tablespoonful
of the cream on the top of the broth in
each cup.</p>

<h3>Bisque of Clams and Green Peas</h3>

<p>Cut a slice of fat salt pork (about
two ounces) in bits; cook in a saucepan
until the fat is well tried out but not in
the least browned; add a small onion,
cut in thin slices, two new carrots, cut
in slices, one or two branches of celery,
broken in pieces, and stir and cook until
softened and yellowed a little; add one
pint of green peas, a branch of parsley
and a pint of water and let cook till
the peas are tender, then press through
a sieve. Cook one pint of fresh clams
in a pint of boiling water five minutes;
drain the broth into the pea purée;
chop the clams and add to the purée.
Melt one-fourth a cup of butter; in it
cook one-fourth a cup of flour; stir
until frothy, then add one quart of
milk and stir until boiling. Add to the
other ingredients and let boil once.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Add salt and pepper, as needed, and
from one-half to a whole cup of cream.</p>

<h3>Purée of Tomato, Julienne</h3>

<p>Chop fine about two ounces of raw,
lean ham; add an onion, cut in thin
slices, two small new carrots, sliced,
half a green pepper, sliced, and two
branches of parsley; cook these, stirring
often, in two or three tablespoonfuls
of fat from the top of a kettle of soup.
When lightly browned, add the bones
from a roast of chicken or veal, the
skinned feet of the chicken, and the
uncooked giblets, if at hand, two quarts
of water and one quart of tomatoes, cut
in slices. Let simmer one hour and a
half. Strain through a fine sieve, pressing
through all the pulp (no seeds).
Reheat, stir one-fourth a cup of flour
with cold water to pour and stir into
the boiling soup. While the soup is
cooking, cut in short julienne strips
two stalks of celery, an onion, a carrot
and a cup of string beans; let cook in
salted water with a teaspoonful of
butter until tender; drain, rinse in cold
water and set aside to serve in the
soup.</p>

<h3>Simple Tomato Bisque (Soup)</h3>

<p>Scald one quart of milk with a stalk
of celery and two slices of onion. Press
enough cooked tomatoes through a
sieve to make one pint; add half a
teaspoonful of salt and pepper as desired.
Stir one-third a cup of flour
and a teaspoonful of salt with milk to
make a smooth batter; dilute with a
little of the hot milk, stir until smooth,
then stir into the rest of the hot milk.
Continue stirring until smooth and
thick; cover and let cook fifteen minutes.
Strain into the hot purée, mix
thoroughly and serve at once with
croutons.</p>

<h3>Jellied Bouillon (Two quarts)</h3>

<p>Have about four pounds of beef
from the hind shin, cut it into small
pieces; melt the marrow from the bone
in a frying pan; in it cook part of the
bits of meat until nicely browned. Put
the bone and the rest of the bits of meat
into a soup kettle and add five pints of
cold water. When the meat is browned,
add it to the soup kettle. Put a cup or
more of the water from the soup
kettle into the frying-pan; let stand
to dissolve the glaze in the pan, then
return to the soup kettle. Cover and
let simmer four or five hours; add half
a cup, each, of sliced onion and carrot,
one or two large branches of parsley,
one or two stalks of celery and let cook
an hour longer. Strain off the broth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and set it aside, first, if necessary, adding
boiling water to make two quarts
of broth. Add also two teaspoonfuls
of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper
and an ounce (half
a package) of gelatine,
softened in
half a cup of cold
water. When cold
and set remove the
fat; break up the
jelly with a spoon or
silver fork; serve in
bouillon cups at any
meal where it is
desired.</p>

<h3>Green Corn Chowder</h3>

<p class="center">(To Serve Six)</p>

<p>Cut two slices (about two ounces) of
fat salt pork into tiny bits; let cook in
a frying-pan until the fat is well tried
out, taking care to keep the whole of a
straw color. Add two small onions, or
one of medium size, cut in thin slices,
and let cook until softened and
yellowed, add a pint of water and let
simmer. In the meantime pare and
cut four potatoes in thin slices, cover
with boiling water and let boil five
minutes; drain, rinse in cold water
and drain again, then strain over them
the water from the onions and pork,
pressing out all the juice possible.
Add more water, if needed, and a teaspoonful
of salt and let cook until the
potatoes are tender. Add a pint of
green corn, carefully cut from the cob,
and one pint of milk, also salt and
pepper to season. Mix thoroughly and
let become very hot, then serve at
once. Two or three tablespoonfuls of
butter may be added, by small bits,
and stirred into the soup just before
serving.</p>

<h3>Escalloped Oysters
Finnelli (The Caterer)</h3>

<p>Select a shallow au gratin dish; pour
into it about two tablespoonfuls of
melted butter and turn the dish, to
spread the butter over the whole
surface. Sprinkle lightly with crushed
saltine crackers or oysterettes; upon
the crumbs dispose a layer of carefully
cleaned oysters; sprinkle with salt and
paprika or other pepper and pour on
three or four tablespoonfuls of rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
cream; add crushed crackers, oysters,
seasoning, one or two tablespoonfuls of
butter, in little bits, then more cream.
Finish with a thin layer of cracker
crumbs and enough cream to moisten
them. Let cook in a very hot oven
about ten minutes or until the crumbs
are straw color.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Terrine of Chicken and Ham, Cooling</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Terrine of Chicken and Ham</h3>

<p>Scrape the pulp from the fibers in
half a pound, each, of veal and fresh
pork; pound this pulp in a mortar; add
the yolks of two raw eggs, half a teaspoonful,
each, of salt and paprika and,
if desired, two tablespoonfuls of sherry
and pound again, then press through
a sieve. Remove the bones from the
breast, second joints and legs of a
young chicken, weighing about two
pounds. Have an oval terrine, or
shallow casserole, that holds about
three pints. Line the bottom and
sides with thin slices of larding pork.
The pork should be cut exceedingly
thin. Over the pork spread a thin
layer of the veal forcemeat mixture,
over this put a thin slice of cold boiled
ham, on the ham a layer of forcemeat,
then half of the chicken (light and dark
meat); sprinkle lightly with salt and
pepper, spread with forcemeat, a layer
of ham, forcemeat, chicken, forcemeat,
ham, forcemeat and, lastly, a layer of
larding pork. Pour in half a cup of
broth, cover, and set the terrine into
an agate dish or a saucepan. Pour in
boiling water to half the height of the
terrine and let cook in the oven one
hour and a half. Remove the cover
and set a board with weight upon it
over the meat, to remain till cold.
Remove fat and loosen the meat from
the dish at the edge. Unmold on a
dish. Ornament with tiny cubes of
jelly (made of broth from the rest of
the chicken and the trimmings of the
veal, thickened with gelatine), slices of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
truffle and lettuce hearts. This dish
is suitable for high tea, lawn parties,
picnics and automobile baskets. Lettuce
served with it should be seasoned
with French dressing.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bologna Style Sausage with Pineapple Fritters</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Bologna Style Sausages with
Pineapple Fritters</h3>

<p>Prick the sausages on all sides that
the skin may not burst in cooking. Set
into a moderate oven in a frying-pan.
Let cook about half an hour, then turn
them and let cook another half hour.
Just before the sausages are done pour
some of the fat into another frying-pan
(or keep the sausage hot on the serving
dish and use the original pan). Have
ready some half slices of pineapple,
roll these in flour and let cook in the
hot fat until browned on one side, then
turn and cook on the other side. If
preferred the pineapple may be dipped
in fritter batter instead of flour. Dispose
the pineapple at the ends of the
dish and serve at once.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Cold Meat with Vegetable Salad</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Cold Meat with Vegetable Salad</h3>

<p>Cut cold meat of any variety in thin
slices; trim off all unedible portions
and dispose neatly in the center of an
ample dish. Around the meat set
heart leaves of lettuce, each holding
six or eight cold, cooked string beans,
cut in pieces, a few slices of radish and
a slice of cooked beet. Pour vinaigrette
sauce over the whole or set a tablespoonful
of mayonnaise or tartare
sauce above the vegetables in each nest.
Tomatoes, cut in slices or in julienne
strips, may be used in place of the beet
and radish, but not with either of
them.</p>

<h3>Vinaigrette Sauce</h3>

<p>Allow a tablespoonful of oil and half
a tablespoonful of vinegar for each
service. To this add one-eighth a
teaspoonful of salt and pepper as desired,
gherkins or capers (the latter
with cold lamb), chives (or onion juice),
chervil and parsley to taste, all chopped
exceedingly fine.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chicken-and-Ham Rissoles</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Chicken-and-Ham Rissoles</h3>

<p>Cut tender cooked chicken and ham,
three-fourths chicken and one-fourth
ham, into tiny cubes. The meat may
be chopped, but it is preferable to have
tangible pieces of small size. For one
pint of meat, melt three tablespoonfuls
of butter; in it cook four tablespoonfuls
of flour and half a teaspoonful, each,
of salt and paprika; when frothy stir
in one cup of chicken broth and half
a cup of cream; stir until boiling, then
add a beaten egg; stir until cooked,
then stir in the meat and let cool. The
mixture should be quite consistent.
Seasonings, as onion or lemon juice,
celery salt, or chopped truffles, or
fresh mushrooms, broken in pieces and
sautéd in butter, may be added at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
pleasure. Have ready some flaky
pastry or part plain and part puff
paste. Stamp out rounds three and a
half or four inches in diameter. If
plain and puff paste be used have an
equal number of rounds of each. On
the rounds of plain paste put a generous
tablespoonful of the meat mixture,
spreading it toward the edge; brush
the edge of the paste with cold water;
make two small openings in each round
of puff paste, press these rounds
over the meat on the others, brush
over with milk, or yolk of egg diluted
with milk and bake in a hot oven.
Serve hot with a tomato or mushroom
sauce, or cold without a sauce.
Cold corned beef is good used in
this way. Rissoles are often brushed
over with egg and fried in deep
fat.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Cheese Salad in Molds lined with Strips of Pimento</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Cheese Salad</h3>

<p>Line each "flute" in small fluted
molds with narrow strips of pimento.
For this recipe six or
seven molds will be
needed. Beat one cup
of cream, one-fourth a
teaspoonful, each, of salt
and paprika till firm.
Soften half a level tablespoonful
of gelatine in
about one-eighth a cup
of cold water; dissolve
by setting the dish
in warm water. To
the dissolved gelatine
add half a cup, generous measure,
of grated cheese of any variety.
Stir until cool, then fold into the
cream. Use this mixture to fill the
molds. When cold and firm unmold
and serve with a plain lettuce
salad. French or mayonnaise dressing
may be used with the lettuce. Bread
or crackers should also be provided.
Hot pulled bread or toasted crackers
are excellent. As the pimentos flavor
the dish strongly, nothing that does
not harmonize with them should be
presented at the same time. If the
pimento prove objectionable&mdash;they
sometimes cause flatulency&mdash;strips of
uncooked tomato may be substituted.</p>

<h3>Plain Pastry</h3>

<p>Sift together two
and one-half cups
of pastry flour, a
teaspoonful of baking
powder and half
a teaspoonful of
salt; work in half a
cup of shortening,
then stir in cold
water as is needed
to make a paste.
Knead slightly on a
floured board; cut
off half the paste for
the lower rounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h3>Flaky Paste</h3>

<p>Roll the other half of the paste into
a rectangular sheet, dot one half with
tiny bits of butter, fold the unbuttered
paste over the other, dot half of this
with bits of butter, fold as before, dot
one half with butter, fold as before,
then roll out into a thin sheet for the
upper rounds. The paste may be
chilled to advantage before rolling. In
pastry making a magic cover may be used
more successfully than a marble slab.</p>

<h3>Pears Béatrice</h3>

<p>Cut choice pears in halves, lengthwise;
remove the skin and the seed
cavity. Cook tender in a little sugar
and water. Cut into small bits enough
French candied fruits to half fill the
cavities in the pears. Mix the fruit
with apricot, peach or apple marmalade
and use to fill the open spaces in
the pears. For a dozen halves of pears,
scald one pint of rich milk; sift together,
several times, three-fourths a cup,
each, of sugar and flour, dilute with
some of the hot milk and stir until
smooth and return to the rest of the
milk; stir the whole until thick and
smooth, cover and let cook fifteen
minutes, stirring occasionally. Beat
the yolks of five eggs; add one-fourth
a cup of sugar and half a teaspoonful
of salt and beat again, then stir into
the hot mixture; continue stirring
until the egg is cooked, then fold in
the whites of five eggs, beaten dry,
continuing the cooking and folding
until the white is set or cooked. Flavor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
with a teaspoonful of vanilla extract.
Turn part of this cream into an au
gratin dish (sometimes called cocotte
and sometimes Welsh rabbit dish).
Dispose the pears in the cream, cover
with the rest of the cream, sprinkle the
whole with dried and pulverized macaroons,
mixed with melted butter. Set
the dish into the oven to brown the
crumbs. Serve hot in the dish.</p>

<h3>Green Corn au Gratin in Ramekins</h3>

<p>Cook one slice of onion and a slice
of green pepper, chopped fine, in one
or two tablespoonfuls of butter, until
softened and yellowed; add two tablespoonfuls
of flour and half a teaspoonful
of salt and cook until frothy; add
two cups of thin cream and cook and
stir until boiling, then stir in sweet corn,
cut from the cob, to make quite a consistent
mixture. One or two beaten
eggs may be added, if desired. Turn
into buttered ramekins and cover with
two-thirds a cup of cracker crumbs
mixed with melted butter; let cook in
the oven until the crumbs are browned.

<h3>Kugelhopf Kuchen
for Afternoon Tea</h3>

<p>Take one pound of flour (four cups),
ten ounces (one cup and a fourth) of
butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar,
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, one
cake of compressed yeast, two or three
tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water and

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Kugelhopf Kuchen Ready To Shape</span></p>
</div>

<p>Soften the yeast in the water, mix
thoroughly, and stir in enough of the
flour to make a soft dough. Knead
the little ball of dough; with a knife
slash across it in opposite directions
and drop it into a small saucepan of
lukewarm water. Put the rest of the
flour, the salt, sugar and butter, broken
up into bits, into a mixing bowl; add
four of the eggs and with the hand work
the whole to a smooth consistency,
then add the rest of the eggs, one at a
time, and continue beating each time
until the paste is smooth. When the
little ball of sponge has become very
light, at least twice its original size,
remove it with a skimmer to the egg
mixture, add a cup of large raisins,
from which the seeds have been removed,
and work the whole together.
Let stand to become double in bulk.
Cut down and set aside in an ice chest
overnight. Shape on a board either
into a loaf or buns. When again light
and puffy bake in a quick oven. Cut
the cake into thick slices.</p>

<p>Toast these over a quick fire, being
careful (by not moving the cake
while toasting) to retain the lines
of the toaster. Spread with butter,
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon,
mixed, and serve at once on a hot
napkin. The sugar and cinnamon may
be omitted.</p>

<h2 class="p6">In Time of Vacation</h2>

<p class="center">By Janet M. Hill</p>

<p class="p2">Any part of a house in disorder
and confusion is a source of
mental distress to a neat and
conscientious housekeeper, and often an
occasion for slurs from other members
of the family. The number of steps
to be taken and the motions to be
made, each day, to keep a house in
order and set three meals upon a table
are often overlooked or largely underestimated.
We are speaking now of
the homes of the "four-fifths," where
little help outside of the family is
available. Mothers are thought "slow
and poky" by the younger members
of the family, who are inclined to
value the slight and irregular assistance
which they give more highly than it
deserves. There are members of the
family, perhaps, who should keep their
strength, mental and physical, for their
work away from home; but in general
the young people should be trained to
take a part in the responsibility of the
housekeeping and home-making. If
boys and girls, as soon as they are old
enough, be taught to open their beds
for airing, hang up their clothing and
leave the bowl and bath tub in suitable
condition for the next occupant
of the room, the mother can prepare
the breakfast and begin the work of
the day without fret as to the condition
of the upper part of the house,
or without the mental fatigue that
comes where there are so many things
to be done at once that one knows not
where to begin.</p>

<p>Often where one maid is kept, too
much is expected of her, even by the
house-mother. With the advent of a
maid, the dishes multiply and time is
spent in dish washing that should be
given to the larger affairs of the housekeeping.
For the mother or one maid the
washing of dishes must be regulated to
make the work an incident and not
the event of the day. We are not
protesting against a change of plates, or
forks, etc., for the dessert; but extra
dishes for vegetables, the plate underneath
the plate, both handled and
therefore to be washed, much glassware
that requires careful washing and
polishing, all tend to prolong the time
at the sink. Such work may be increased
at will, when some one is hired
for this special purpose, or when the
daughter of the family is willing to
take the responsibility of it. For the
mother or the one maid, day in and
day out, more necessary duties must
eliminate some of the niceties of table
service. We should not be "more nice
than wise."</p>

<p>We believe in work; it is the refuge
and the safeguard of the race: but
there must be times for relaxation and
repose, and, that this be possible for
each member of the family, there must
be a division of labor. If one individual
be a drone, some one else is
obliged to work for him. We wish to
emphasize the necessity of systematic
training, in the doing of these daily
duties, of the young people in a family.
Let each child be held responsible for
a certain amount of work each day.
It will not burden the normal child,
but will give satisfaction and a feeling
of being of use in the world. No better
time than this, the vacation season,
can be found for putting in practice
the idea herein suggested.</p>

<p>We are admonished by many innovations
that times have changed.
The fact that graduates from Colleges
of Home Economics are taught to see
the subject in "its broad relations, both
to science and to practice," and that
every graduate is expected "to have
a fair working knowledge of the household-arts"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and be able to cook a meal
or make a dress, has given the practice
of the so-called homely arts an impetus
that will do much for the betterment
of the race. Cooking and sewing have
had a renaissance. To be able to cook
well is a desideratum to be desired, and
rivalry in pleasing and artistic tea-rooms,
"cake and cooky shops" and
places for the sale of cooked food is
abroad in the land. We look to see
this same pleasing rivalry displayed
in dressmaking rooms and laundries,
where fine work can be essayed.
These private and small enterprises,
which might grow into larger ones,
should furnish a generous return for
the time and money invested and an
increase in the happiness of those employed
as well as of those whom they
serve. All of these ventures are at
once a source of independence to the
serving and the served, and give an
opportunity for self-direction that
argues well for their permanency.</p>

<p>Earthen dishes for cooking, which
conserve heat and answer for serving
as well as cooking, are to be commended
at all seasons; but in hot weather,
when it is eminently desirable to limit
heat and work, they are more than
ever a source of pleasure and comfort.
Not so very long ago all such ware was
imported, and the duty, added to the
first cost, placed it in the list of luxuries,
but now the dainty contours of
all these casseroles, ramekins, terrines,
au gratin dishes, etc., are duplicated in
American ware, and at a price that
puts the goods within the reach of all.
In the seasonable recipes for this
issue, terrine of chicken and ham,
green corn au gratin in ramekins, and
pears Béatrice are cooked in Guernsey
earthen ware. An extremely useful dish
in this ware is the mixing bowl in which
Kugelhopf kuchen, ready for shaping,
is shown. Nothing daintier for mixing
purposes than this bowl of smooth and
highly polished interior can be imagined;
from such a surface any mixture can
be rinsed with ease, and thus the labor
of dish washing is lessened, which is a
strong point in favor of any utensil.</p>

<h2 class="p6">A Group of Choice Spanish and Mexican Recipes</h2>

<p class="center">By Mrs. L. Rice</p>

<h3>Baked Tripe, Spanish</h3>

<p>Boil four pounds of fresh tripe
until tender; drain and sprinkle
with salt and pepper, and arrange
in a well-buttered dish. Pour
over it one quart of chopped tomatoes,
one large onion, sliced very thin, one-half
a cup of chopped parsley, and skin
of one large red pepper, minced fine,
one-half a cup of chopped olives and
one teaspoonful of tabasco sauce. Pour
over all one-half a cup of melted
butter and bake one hour.</p>

<p>This is equal to finest fish and is
certainly delicious.</p>

<h3>Chili Con Carne, Spanish</h3>

<p>To prepare the chili used in this
dish: from two pods of dried red chili
peppers take out all the seeds and
discard them. Soak the pods in warm
water until soft, then scrape pulp from
the skins into the water, discarding
the skins and saving the pulp and
water. Cut two pounds of round steak
into small pieces and cook in hot
frying pan, in pork drippings, until
well browned; add three or four tablespoonfuls
of flour and stir until browned,
then add one clove of garlic, in which
two gashes have been cut, and chili
water, of which there should be about
one pint; let simmer until meat is
tender (about two hours), adding hot
water if needed.</p>

<p>When done the sauce should be of
good consistency; add salt to taste.</p>

<h3>String Beans, Spanish</h3>

<p>Take two pounds of green string
beans and chop fine. Put one tablespoonful
of bacon drippings in a frying
pan and one onion, cut fine, half a dry
red pepper, cut fine; let onion and
pepper fry brown, then add three ripe
tomatoes, cut fine, and stir in one
tablespoonful of flour; then add one
quart of cold water; then the chopped
beans, with salt and pepper to taste,
and let the beans cook until tender;
keep adding water as needed, so as
not to let them get too dry.</p>

<h3>Spaghetti à la Mexicana</h3>

<p>Fry three large pork chops brown.
Fry three minced onions and two
cloves of garlic in pork drippings. Put
the chops and onions into a granite
kettle with two cans of tomatoes and
two green chili pepper pods (remove
the seeds), one tablespoonful, each, of
dry chili powder, brown sugar, tarragon
vinegar and sage, one teaspoonful
of Worcestershire sauce and celery
salt, table salt to suit; let simmer
slowly until pork chops fall to pieces;
strain through coarse colander. This
sauce should be of the consistency of
thick cream, without adding any thickening.</p>

<p>Boil one-half a package of spaghetti
in large kettle of salted boiling water;
do not break into short pieces, but
drop ends into the water and gradually
immerse the whole stick. Keep the
water boiling rapidly, adding boiling
water as it boils down; do not cover;
let boil forty-five minutes, drain in
colander and pour one quart of cold
water through to blanch.</p>

<p>Put the spaghetti into the tomato
sauce and set on stove where it will
keep hot, but not boil, for fifteen
minutes. Arrange in a deep platter
and sprinkle top with grated Parmesan
cheese.</p>

<p>Serve with grated cheese and stuffed
olives. If care is taken in preparing
this dish you will be rewarded with
something certainly delicious, and a
typical Mexican dish.

<h3>Rice, Spanish</h3>

<p>Put two frying pans on the stove,
and in each put one teaspoonful of
bacon fat. Take one onion and four
green chilis, chop very fine, salt; put
this in one frying pan and cook until
done without browning. In the other
pan, put one cup of rice, washed and
dried; stir and let cook a light brown;
add the onion and chilis and one cup of
tomato; fill frying pan with boiling
water and let cook until rice is dry.</p>

<h3>Ice Cream à la Mexicana</h3>

<p>Put two cups of granulated sugar
in saucepan over fire and stir constantly
until it is melted; add two cups
of English walnut meats and pour
into shallow, buttered pan to harden.
When perfectly cold, grate or chop
fine. Crumble two dozen macaroons
into fine crumbs, then toast in hot
oven a few minutes. Now make a rich,
boiled custard, of yolks of four eggs,
one-half a cup of sugar and two cups
of cream, then pour over the stiff-beaten
whites of two eggs and let cool.
To one quart of cream add one-third
a cup of sugar and beat until thoroughly
mixed, add to the custard, and
flavor with vanilla or maraschino, then
freeze. When half frozen add the
macaroon crumbs and half of the
grated walnut mixture and finish freezing.
Let ripen two or three hours.
Sprinkle remaining grated walnuts
over the cream when serving. This
is the typical ice cream of Mexico, just
as it is served there.</p>

<h3>Caramels à la Mexicana</h3>

<p>Put one cup of granulated sugar
in an iron skillet and stir constantly
over a slow fire until the sugar is
melted. As soon as the sugar becomes
syrup, add one cup of rich milk or
cream,<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and stir until sugar is dissolved.
Add, next, one cup, each, of
granulated and light brown sugar and
boil steadily until mixture forms a soft
ball when tested in cold water. Take
from the fire, add one cup of coarse
chopped nut meats and stir to creamy
consistency. Pour into shallow pans,
lined with paraffine paper, spread
smoothly about half an inch in thickness
and mark into squares while
warm.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Dissolve the caramel in half a cup of boiling water,
then add the cream or milk; by this means the liability
of the milk or cream to curdle is lessened.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

<h2 class="p6">The Nursery</h2>

<p class="center">By E. R. Parker</p>

<p class="p2">It is frequently a matter of surprise
to foreigners that in the average
American home, which is otherwise
so well equipped, little or no attention
is given to the nursery, and it is
to this neglect they trace many of the
shortcomings of our little ones.</p>

<p>It may be that the busy mother, who
has to perform the duties of nursemaid
and perhaps look after her household
at the same time, sees little
reason for having a room specially
dedicated to the use of the children;
but when one considers the necessity
of regularity in the feeding, bathing,
sleeping, and every other particular of
the infant's daily life, such a need
becomes apparent, with the arrival of
the first baby. Select a room in a
secluded part of the house, and one
which receives all the sunshine possible,
for the nursery. Fresh air should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
admitted at all times, but in such a
manner as to avoid drafts. For the
use of the young infant, limit the furnishings
to bare necessities, and have
the floor and walls hard finished. It
is not well to have plumbing of any
kind in the room, nor should it be
directly connected with the bathroom.
Regulate the temperature carefully,
letting it range between 75 and 80
degrees Fahr. during the first week;
after that it may be kept at 75 degrees
until the child is three months old, and
then gradually lowered to 70 degrees
or even 65, at night. Needless to say
the metal crib is the most important
furnishing; it should be fitted with a
soft hair mattress and a thin pillow,
though some persons prefer to use no
pillow at all. Under no circumstances
should the baby sleep with its mother,
and eminent physicians now agree that
it is more or less injurious for a child
to sleep in the room with an adult.
Dr. Cotton, the distinguished specialist
for children, recommends, as additional
furnishings for the infant's room, a
flexible rubber bathtub, a bath thermometer,
wall thermometer, scales and
a double ewer and soap dish on a low
table surrounded by a high folding
screen.</p>

<p>As the child grows older it will require
the addition of low chairs, tables,
etc., in the nursery; these should be
simple and substantial. Do not fit up
the nursery with broken or cast-off
articles of furniture from other parts
of the house. Few mothers realize
what a deep impression these early
surroundings make upon the child, and
how nervous, sensitive children may
be made to endure positive suffering
from contact with unsightly objects.</p>

<p>A window seat, that will also serve
as a convenient receptacle for toys, may
be made by having the top hinged on
a low wooden box, and covering the
box with some suitable dark material.
Do not make the mistake of giving
children a quantity of toys at one
time; such a practice has the bad effect
of dulling their sense of enjoyment
and making them tire easily of their
playthings. If fond relations insist
upon trying to shower all the dolls and
books and drums in town on them for
one Christmas or birthday celebration,
try putting some of them away and
keeping them for rainy days or the
trying period of convalescence. Toys
which will excite the imagination and
leave something to their own ingenuity
are to be preferred to those that are
complete in themselves. Among the
former are paints, brushes and outline
pictures, games, dolls with patterns
and material for clothing, stone building
blocks, which come in different sizes
and shapes with designs for building.</p>

<p>Decorate the walls with stencil designs
or a few good pictures, which
should be chosen with reference to the
child's age. Few persons are aware
that until a child is three years old he
cannot distinguish clearly between
green, gray and blue, hence decorations
containing these colors are lost
upon him, and the reason for his love
of red and yellow is apparent. The
Perkins pictures, issued by the Prang
Educational Company, are justly popular
for nursery walls, and photographs
of the masterpieces can be purchased
quite reasonably. A small bookcase
should also be given an honored place
in the nursery, for older children, and
nothing but books of the very best
from a literary standpoint, well printed
on good paper and substantially bound,
should find their way to its shelves.
Cheap toy books from the five and
ten cent counters, many of which are
poorly bound, grotesquely illustrated
and insipid in contents, had better be
kept away from the children. I would
rather give them one good book a year
than an armful of poor ones. Some
children do not enjoy being read to,
but all of them love a story, and, with
a little tact on the part of the mother,
it is but a step from the story she tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to the one she reads, and she can easily
cultivate a taste for good reading, for,
after all, she is the genius that shapes
and molds, and without whom the
most ideal nursery is but a dreary
place. We are told that even the songs
she sings to the babe at her breast have
an occult influence over its future life.
What a power and privilege, then, are
hers to guide the little groping hands
and watch the unfolding mind; and
surely she should spare neither time
nor trouble in the accomplishment of
such a task!</p>

<h2 class="p6">Practical Home Dietetics</h2>

<p class="center">By Minnie Genevieve Morse</p>

<p class="center">II. The Rôle of Diet in Reducing and Increasing Weight</p>

<p class="p2">In addition to the natural and proper
inclination to make the best of
oneself, there is scientific reason
in the stout woman's desire to reduce
her weight, and the painfully thin
woman's wish to take on a few more
pounds of flesh; health itself is at its
best when the body maintains its
normal proportions, without serious
loss or gain. Any considerable variation
from the normal standard shows
a disturbance in the balance of nutrition;
either the vital fire is being fed
too generously, and the excess of fuel,
instead of being turned into heat and
energy, is accumulating in the tissues,
to be a burden to the organism and,
perhaps in time, cause disease, or else
the expenditure of force is greater
than the supply of fuel, the bodily
tissues are drawn upon to aid in feeding
the fire, and all the systems of the
body suffer from the insufficiency of
nourishment. Stout people become
increasingly disinclined to either physical
or mental exertion; they are apt to
suffer from indigestion and constipation,
rheumatic troubles and shortness
of breath; and, when a condition of
actual obesity is reached, a fatty
degeneration of one or more of the
vital organs is liable. The insufficiently
nourished person, on the other hand,
is usually anæmic and nervous, the
weak and faulty performance of many
of the bodily functions testifying to
the lack of proper nutrition.</p>

<p>With regard to the matter of physical
attractiveness, the advantage of proper
proportion between the weight and the
height is obvious. The too-thin woman
has fewer difficulties to contend with
than her too-stout sister, in fulfilling
fashion's requirements, for her figure
can be modified to a far greater extent
by the dressmaker's art. But the face
and hands cannot be filled out correspondingly,
and the thin woman early
takes on lines and wrinkles, usually
looking much older than a plumper
woman of the same age.</p>

<p>Proper balance between the intake
of food and the outgo of energy is
thus necessary, both for the maintenance
of good health and for the
preservation of one's fair share of
natural comeliness. The generally-accepted
standard of weight in proportion
to height which a woman should
maintain, in order to fulfil these requirements,
is as follows: Five feet
one inch, 120 pounds; five feet two
inches, 126 pounds; five feet three
inches, 133 pounds; five feet four
inches, 136 pounds; five feet five
inches, 142 pounds; five feet six inches,
145 pounds; five feet seven inches, 149
pounds; five feet eight inches, 155
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
pounds; five feet nine inches, 162
pounds; five feet ten inches, 169 pounds.</p>

<p>The purposes for which food is taken
into the body are two: the rebuilding
of the bodily tissues, which are constantly
consumed by physical and
mental activities, and the production
of heat and energy. During the period
of growth, the body necessarily demands
a large amount of tissue-building
material, and it is natural and
reasonable that a growing child should
have a large appetite, and be ready to
eat at all times of day. If, however,
a person who has come to maturity
continues to eat as heartily as in early
life, more food is taken into the body
than is required after the growing
period is ended, a heavy strain is put
upon the organs which remove waste
products from the system, and there is
likely to be a deposition of fat in the
tissues. Another factor in producing
these results is the fact that the adult
usually leads a far less active life,
physically, than the growing child, so
that less food is needed for transformation
into energy, as well as for the
purpose of body-building.</p>

<p>This is even more true now than it
was a few generations ago; the higher
standard of luxury in the modern
manner of life, labor-saving devices of
every kind, and improved transportation
facilities, which have almost reduced
out-door exercise to a matter of
country-club athletics, are among the
reasons for the present-day lack of
physical activity among both men and
women. It must not be forgotten,
however, that our high-pressure modern
life also favors the existence of a class,
who, instead of feeding their vital fires
too generously, are inadequately nourished;
among the contributing factors
in this case are improper food, hasty
and unattractively served meals, unhygienic
ways of living, and the heavy,
nervous strain that makes havoc of so
many lives, in one way or another.</p>

<p>Considering first the case of the
woman who is above the normal
standard of weight, it may be said in
the beginning that there are few stout
people who cannot safely, and without
resorting to any dubious measures,
reduce their weight sufficiently to improve
not only their appearance, but
their comfort and general vigor as well.
Such results are not produced in a
moment, however, and patience, perseverence
and a considerable exercise
of will-power may be necessary.</p>

<p>Any decided deviation from one's
usual manner of life should not be
undertaken without the advice of a
competent physician. Constitutions,
have been wrecked, and even lives
lost, by such tampering with nature's
laws. Exercise and diet are the two
great aids in reducing weight, but
either, by being carried to extremes,
or attempted under unsuitable conditions,
may do more harm than good.
One procedure which cannot be too
strongly condemned is the use of the
various "anti-fat" preparations, which
are among the patent medicines that
have afflicted a credulous world; such
"remedies" are worse than useless, as
they may do actual harm by upsetting
the digestion, or otherwise disturbing
nutrition, while it is beyond the power
of any drug to control such a complex
process as that of the balance between
waste and repair in the human body.
If the desired effect is actually produced,
it is by a lowering of the general
health.</p>

<p>Many systems of exercises have been
recommended for reducing flesh, especially
about the waist and hips, and,
when used in moderation, and with a
physician's assurance that none of the
organs of the body will be injured by
their use, the following out of such a
system will not only aid in reducing
the weight, but will improve circulation
and nutrition, and increase the
general bodily vigor. The exercises
usually recommended consist principally
of reaching, stretching and bending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
movements, but breathing exercises
are also useful, as deep breathing aids
in burning up fat. Stair climbing, with
the body erect and only the ball of the
foot placed on each step, is also highly
recommended, and for reducing the fat
on the hips the "standing run" is
especially valuable. Tennis, golf, bicycling,
and horseback riding, all aid in
keeping down weight. Walking is,
however, the exercise <i>par excellence</i> for
stout people; not a slow and languid
saunter, but a brisk pace, and a steadily
increasing distance. Hill climbing,
<i>when there is no danger of overtaxing</i>
the heart, is even more effective than
walking on a level.</p>

<p>A noted physician, who has successfully
reduced many stout patients,
lately made the statement that many
fat people were willing to take any
sort of treatment that was ordered for
them, if only their diet was not restricted.
It is upon restriction of diet,
however, that the chief dependence
must be placed, in the reduction of
weight; exercise produces a more rapid
burning up of fat in the body, but
superfluous fat cannot be stored up, if
the material for it is not supplied to
the system. Many famous systems of
reduction by restricted diet have been
given to the world, but most of them
are so severe that they should only be
used under the direction of a physician.
All of these systems require a reduction
of the total amount of food taken,
a restriction of the quantity of fluid
allowed, and a more or less strict
avoidance of those food substances
which are most readily turned into fat
in the body. Most of them also provide
for light lunches in the middle of
the morning and afternoon, as these
additional meals tend to lessen the
appetite at the heavier meals of the
day.</p>

<p>The fat-making foods include sugars,
starches, fat meats, butter and oil.
It is not safe to deprive the body
entirely of these groups of food substances,
since proper nutrition depends
upon a wholesomely balanced diet, but
the amount of them taken by the
average person can be very greatly cut
down without any danger to health.
It is not unusual for a single meal to
include a cream soup, bread and butter,
potatoes, macaroni, a starchy vegetable,
such as beans, a salad dressed
with oil, and a rice or cornstarch
pudding,&mdash;a list of articles which, as
may readily be seen, contains a much
larger amount of fat-making food than
is required by the actual needs of the
body.</p>

<p>The woman who is in earnest to
reduce her weight, then, should eat at
each meal as little of the sweet or
starchy articles of food and of the fats
and oils as is compatible with health.
Soup is best omitted altogether, not
only because the cream soups and
purées contain much fat-making material,
but also because as little fluid
as possible should be taken with meals.
Among fish, salmon, bluefish and eels
contain more fat than the other varieties
of sea food. Fat meats and all forms of
pork should be avoided. The potato is
eaten so universally, appearing upon
our tables at almost every meal, that
its omission from the diet often seems
a severe deprivation; however, it is
one of the starchiest of foods, and
should be cut entirely out of a menu
planned for the reduction of weight.
Most of the other vegetables grown
below ground are also undesirable for
the stout person; this class includes
turnips, carrots, parsnips and beets,&mdash;not,
however, onions or radishes. Peas
and beans also contain a good deal of
starch. It is almost impossible to
eliminate bread-stuffs from the diet,
yet much indulgence in the "bread and
butter habit" is fatal to the woman
who desires to grow thin. Bread has
least flesh-forming power when thoroughly
toasted; whole-wheat bread
contains less starch than that made of
the ordinary white flour, while gluten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
bread contains still less, and is the
most desirable form for the stout
person's use. Macaroni and spaghetti,
rice, and the breakfast cereals are all
included in the list of very starchy
foods, and should, therefore, be avoided.
Sweets of every sort&mdash;cakes, pies,
puddings, ice cream, confectionery,
chocolate, jam and preserves&mdash;are forbidden
to one who is engaged in a
flesh-reducing campaign. Very little
butter should be eaten; no mayonnaise
dressing or olive oil in any form, no
cream, and not much milk,&mdash;none at
all with meals.</p>

<p>The list of articles allowed includes
almost all kinds of fresh fish; lean
meats and chicken; eggs; bread in
small quantities, when stale or toasted;
all fresh, green vegetables, such as
spinach, lettuce, celery, asparagus and
tomatoes; and nearly all kinds of fresh
fruits, except bananas, which are
largely made up of starch. Fruits
stewed without sugar are also permitted.
This is neither a starvation
diet nor prison fare, but it does mean
a monotonous bill of fare, and considerable
will-power is required to follow
such a regimen for a long period.
Where a reducing diet is adopted without
the advice of a physician, it is a
safer plan to eat smaller portions of
the flesh-forming foods than one is
accustomed to, than to cut them out
of the menu altogether.</p>

<p>Drinking liquids with meals is conducive
to increase in weight: not more
than one small cup of tea or coffee,
or one small glass of water, should be
taken with a meal. Water should,
however, be taken between meals; it
is dangerous to cut the amount of
water taken in twenty-four hours down
to a small quantity, as a deficiency of
water in the system is liable to prevent
the kidneys from doing their proper
work. Chocolate and cocoa are fattening.
Beer and ale are well known to
have flesh-forming properties, and all
alcoholic beverages are better avoided.</p>

<p>Napping after meals aids in putting
on flesh, and should not be indulged in.
Standing for twenty minutes or half an
hour after meals is a help in preventing
the deposition of fat about the hips
and abdomen, the erect position promoting
a more equal distribution of the
products of nutrition.</p>

<p>Any tendency to constipation is to
be prevented. Laxative fruits and
vegetables, such as oranges, apples,
spinach and lettuce, will be helpful
here, as will a glass of cold water taken
on rising in the morning.</p>

<p>The dietetic treatment of excessive
thinness usually appears to one who
is engaged in trying to reduce her
weight as liberty to indulge in all the
good things of this life. However, it
is sometimes more difficult to build up
a thin person than to reduce a stout
one; restriction of diet and persistence
in active exercise are practically certain
to cause a loss of weight, while
many factors, besides a too-slender diet,
may be at the bottom of the thin
woman's condition. Diseases of many
different organs, a run-down nervous
condition, too much hard work and
too little rest, improper food, and disorders
of the digestive tract are among
the causes that may produce malnutrition,
and the first measure adopted
by the painfully thin person should be
a frank talk with her family physician,
as the diet required may not be that
intended especially for increasing
weight, but one that shall improve
nutrition by remedying the defective
working of some organ or system of
the body.</p>

<p>It is practically hopeless to attempt
to build up a patient when the proper
conditions cannot be secured; where
there is no possibility of relief from a
severe physical, mental or nervous
strain, where a sufficient amount of
sleep is impossible, or where there can
be no escape from an unhygienic way
of life, the wisest dietetic measures will
accomplish as much as can be expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of them, if they merely enable the body
to hold its own without further loss
of weight and strength.</p>

<p>Under favoring circumstances, however,
the sugars, starches, fats and
oils, which the stout person must avoid,
are the food substances from which the
thin person may expect the most beneficial
results. Foods difficult of digestion
should be excluded from the menu, as
an attack of indigestion might mean a
considerable set-back, but many of the
most nourishing and fat-producing
articles of food are readily digested and
assimilated, though they should not,
of course, be used to the exclusion of
other kinds of food.</p>

<p>A quart or two of milk a day, when
taken in addition to the regular meals,
will often work wonders; the cream
should be stirred into it, not removed,
and a raw egg may be beaten into an
occasional glassful. Butter should be
spread with a generous hand, salad
dressings should contain as much oil
as is practicable, and a tablespoonful
of pure olive oil, taken after each meal,
will be an effective aid, and also promote
the free action of the bowels, that
is so great a help in bringing about a
condition of general good health.</p>

<p>Properly-made bread, potatoes,
starchy vegetables, like beans and peas
and corn, macaroni and spaghetti, rice,
and the whole array of well-made
breakfast cereals, with a generous
supply of sugar and cream, should be
well represented in the thin person's
diet. Cream sauces should be used
frequently with meat, fish or vegetables,
and cream soups and purées
are to be preferred to bouillons and
other thin soups. Ice cream, milk
puddings, and other nourishing desserts
may have a place in the menu, as may
all sorts of sweet fruits, chocolate and
cocoa, honey, maple sugar and syrup,
and even simple and pure confectionery.
There are few articles of food that are
forbidden to the woman who desires
to increase her weight, except those
which put a strain upon the digestion.
A luncheon in the middle of the morning
and one in the afternoon, with a
glass of hot milk before retiring, assist
very greatly in the building-up process,
while a nap, or at least a quiet rest,
after the midday meal, enables the
system to put to the best uses the fuel
which has been supplied to it. Long
hours of sleep, avoidance of hurry and
tension, regular hours for meals and
pleasant surroundings, and conversation
at mealtimes, are all aids in overcoming
the tendency to excessive thinness.</p>

<p>With regard to both the stout and
thin, it may be said that while the
quantity and kind of food which is put
into the body is unquestionably the
greatest factor in maintaining a proper
balance between its waste and repair,
its income and outgo of energy, it is
necessary to take a common-sense view
of all the circumstances of each individual
case: to make sure that there is no
organ of the body whose functions are
improperly performed; to avoid alike
the temptation, on the one hand, to
decreased activity, and, on the other,
the tendency to over-exertion; to lead
a well-balanced and hygienic life; and
to practise, not only with regard to the
pleasures of the table, but in everything
that pertains to both physical
and mental health, that wise choice
and accustomed self control that are
the mark of the highest type of
humanity.</p>

<h3>A Handy Laundry Bag</h3>

<p>A convenient laundry bag for
use in each sleeping apartment
is easily made of a square piece of stout
material of desired size, hemmed round
the edge, and having a two-inch strap
of the material securely sewed to each
corner.</p>

<p>When the four straps are slipped over
a closet hook, a handy bag is formed,
easily accessible at four different places,
and easily emptied of every article by
simply dropping one of the corners.
Such bags are pretty, made in colors to
correspond with the room in which
they are used. When desiring to carry
the soiled clothes to the laundry in the
receptacle in which they are gathered,
these square bags will be found much
easier to handle than the long ones.</p>

<h3>Assisting Memory</h3>

<p>One of the great helps in my housekeeping
is a small blackboard on my
kitchen wall.</p>

<p>Any special plan, anything about the
house that I discover requires attention,
or any list of materials desired, are
noted on this board. I then dismiss the
matter from my mind. Each morning
I look it over carefully, erasing anything
that has been disposed of or
passed by, place on it any new record
necessary, and note the special duties
of the day or week. In this way I am
reminded of the many duties of my
housekeeping without being unduly
burdened with them.</p>

<p>If more conscientious housewives
would try this plan, I think there
would be fewer nervous women. It is
the carrying of the multitudinous
duties of housekeeping in the memory
long before they are actually performed
that proves so burdensome.</p>

<h3>An Improvised Coat Closet</h3>

<p>In a house having no hall or place
to hang the coats and hats in common
use, I recently saw a very clever
improvised closet. The frame was
made of wood and stained oak; it was
about five feet high, and fitted into a
corner back of the dining-room door,
being about four feet across the front
and three feet deep. Over this frame
green burlap was tacked smoothly with
fancy brass-headed nails. The entire
front opened out like a door. The top
was covered to make it dust-proof,
and a piece of stout canvas formed
the floor. Around the inside stout
cleats were attached to the framework,
into which hooks were placed for the
clothing.</p>

<p>In another house similarly restricted
one corner of the dining-room was made
equally convenient, but not so well
protected from the dust, by placing on
the wall several racks for the clothing.
To hide this a large screen was placed
about it, also having hooks upon the
back.</p>

<p>Neither arrangement in any way
disfigured the room, and a great deal
of running up and down stairs was
saved.</p>

<h3>Pickles Without Heat</h3>

<p>Pack sound, clean vegetables in a
stone jar, a layer of vegetables and
salt; do not be sparing with the salt.
Let these remain at least two days.
Rinse <i>well</i> in cold water. Press out
carefully all the water. Cover with
vinegar, let stand over night, then
press this vinegar out. Put the vegetables
in a jar and pour over it the
following: Two quarts good cider
vinegar, three pounds brown sugar
(light), a good handful, each, of whole
cloves and cinnamon bark, one-half
pound celery seed, one-half ounce
tumeric, one-eighth pound ground mustard,
one-half pound white mustard
seed. Dissolve sugar, mustard and
tumeric well, pour over vegetables, let
stand over a week before beginning to
eat. Cabbage, onions and cucumbers
are the vegetables used. Be sure the
cabbage is white and firm; split the
cucumbers and slice the onions. This
is not heated or cooked.</p>

<p>Be sure the seasoned vinegar covers
the vegetables.</p>

<p>I find lard pails very convenient
receptacles for dry supplies like
rice, beans, etc. I choose those whose
covers come off easily, and paste paper,
on which the name of the contents is
written, on each one. The pails are
so much easier to handle than the glass
jars, and they are also less apt to
become broken.</p>

<p>Many people do not seem to know
of the effectiveness of banana skins in
cleaning tan leather suit cases and
similar articles. Rub the leather well
with the inside of the skin, then wipe
off any excess of moisture with a dry
cloth, finishing with a good polishing
with the same.</p>

<p>I had read of kerosene being a
splendid remedy for burns, but had
never tried it. A short time ago, however,
I found the soda can empty when
most needed, and had to resort to the
kerosene. On immersing my finger in
the liquid, so that the burned portion
was submerged, I found the pain
quickly disappeared. Not a sign of a
blister arose, and the burn healed much
more quickly than those treated in the
other way had done. Now we use
kerosene exclusively for this purpose.</p>

<p>In these days of high prices, when
home-makers are striving to feed
their families well, at as low cost as
possible, it is often the saving of little
things that keeps down the provision
bill. One should know how to combine
left overs so they may realize the best
results both in the amount of money
saved and the amount of nourishment
given. Save the liquor in which a ham
has been cooked. The fat from the
top may be used for sautéing potatoes
or pressed sliced cereals, or with
scrambled eggs, and lends a delicious
flavor when so used. The cooled
liquor forms a "jelly" rich in extractives.
There are frequently pieces
of bread left that are in good condition.
These pieces of bread, also left-over
buttered toast, may be used to thicken
pea soup; and the bone from the ham,
cracked so that the marrow may slip
out, and also the "jelly" from the cold
ham liquor may be used to flavor the
soup. If the ham is very salt, care must
be taken not to add too much "jelly."
It is best to add the "jelly" about one-half
an hour before the soup is done.</p>

<p>Some exquisite centerpieces from
outdoor flowers are made of marsh
marigolds and ferns, or buttercups and
ferns, in cut glass or carved Parian
marble; of violets, purple and white,
in a silver bowl, and apple blossoms, in
polished copper.</p>

<p>Following is a dessert recipe much
enjoyed in my own family:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<h3>Rhubarb Sponge</h3>

<p>Clean and cut in one-half inch
pieces one pound of rose rhubarb.
Do not remove the skin. Stew until
quite tender in one-fourth a cup of
boiling water, just enough to start
the steam. Soften one ounce of granulated
gelatine in one-third a cup of
cold water. Strain the cooked rhubarb,
pressing out all the juice, and
add enough boiling water, if necessary,
to make three cups. Mix one and
three-fourths cups of sugar and one-half
a teaspoonful of ground ginger.
Stir in the rhubarb juice, and add to
the gelatine, stirring until the gelatine
and sugar are dissolved. Add the
grated rind and strained juice of one
lemon and set the mixture to chill.
When it begins to thicken, add the
stiff-beaten whites of three eggs and
beat till stiff. Mold. Serve with
beaten and sweetened cream. Cut
nuts or macaroon crumbs may be
passed with this dessert.</p>

<h3>Tempting a Delicate Child to Eat</h3>

<p>Every mother knows how hard it
is to get children to eat at times,
especially when they first begin to
take solid foods, or when they are
convalescent, while there are some
children who seem to have a natural
and persistent aversion toward whatever
is nourishing and particularly
good for them. Mothers are sometimes
at their wits' end to know what to
prepare, and almost sick with discouragement
when wholesome, necessary
foods are persistently refused.</p>

<p>Sometimes a little ingenuity and an
appeal to the child's imagination or
eye will induce him to eat a good-sized
meal when, at first, he rejected
everything.</p>

<p>There are many simple ways of
doing this, and the mother will find
any number of her own by experimenting.</p>

<p>It is an old custom to cut a slice of
bread into slips, naming them for
members of the family or friends, but
it is a procedure which seems to fascinate
most little ones and make the
bread more palatable. They get so
interested in the various characters,
represented by the slips of bread, that
it disappears before they realize it.</p>

<p>Slices of bread and butter can be
cut into various shapes, such as
diamonds, squares, circles, etc., also
to represent animals, dogs, cats and
horses. The shapes may be crude and
mystifying to behold, but children are
not critical, and generally accept these
representations with approval and
credulity.</p>

<p>Often quite a good-sized meal can be
coaxed down by putting it into the
doll's dishes, filling the tiny cups with
milk and putting little squares of bread
on the small plates. One child was
known to eat a good-sized meal in this
way when he absolutely refused the
food in other form.</p>

<p>Another way is to provide a pretty
china plate with a picture on it, and
tell the child to eat the contents so
that he will see the picture.</p>

<p>Sometimes an interesting story can
be told&mdash;with the proviso that the
child "eat his dinner" or the mother
will not tell the story. He will get interested
in the story and forget how
much he is eating until it is all gone.</p>

<p>One little boy persistently refused
rice, which the physician had ordered
for him and his mother had tried in
every way to make him eat. One day
she conceived the idea of forming the
rice into a small mound like an Eskimo
hut, smoothing it around to make it
an exact reproduction. On the top
she placed a small square of butter,
which she called the chimney. It
happened that the little boy had been
much interested in pictures of Eskimo
children and their homes, and it appealed
to his imagination at once.
The mother then buttered a slice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
bread and cut it into strips&mdash;some
large and some small&mdash;which she
called the family who lived in the
hut&mdash;father, mother, girls, boys and
baby. For this she had the satisfaction
of seeing the little fellow eat two
good slices of bread and the whole
saucer of rice&mdash;a thing he had never
done before&mdash;and with enjoyment.</p>

<p>These are but a few devices. Any
mother can supplement them with
successful ones of her own, and she will
find that by the use of a little imagination
and ingenuity a child can be
tempted to eat almost any kind of
desirable and necessary food, and
enjoy it.</p>

<p>In order to preserve weathered oak
furniture and keep it fresh, rub it
with floor wax, Johnston's or some
other wax for hard floors. Do this
once or twice a year.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Instead of throwing away the flour
left after rolling meat for frying,
save it and use again for similar
purpose.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>Cut a groove around the handle of
the broom about three inches from the
end. Make a cap with a draw string
of some dark soft material and fasten
this over the end of the broom. Then
when the end of the broom rests against
the wall there will be no marred places
on the walls. This idea is especially
good where one has white walls.</p>

<p>There is nothing that equals the
boiled icing, and by boiling the sugar
and water without stirring until it
spins threads when run off a spoon
or fork, then turning this syrup
on the whites of the eggs, which
have been whipped dry, then beaten
until cold, one will have a delicious
covering.</p>

<p>Your correspondent, who presents
Query No. 1590, in the April magazine,
has the German incorrect in her question.
The recipe called for is undoubtedly
Blitz Kuchen or Quick Coffee
Cake. I enclose my recipe, which makes
a delicious cake.</p>

<h3>Blitz Kuchen</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Query 1625.</span>&mdash;"Recipe for Tomato Aspic
for salads and a well-seasoned Cream of

<h3>Tomato (Aspic?) Jelly</h3>

<p>Let two cups of canned tomato, a
sprig of summer savory, sprig of
parsley, a slice of onion, half a stalk of
celery, and a piece of green or red
pepper pod simmer together fifteen or
twenty minutes, then strain the whole
through a fine sieve; add one-fourth a
two-ounce package of gelatine, softened
in one-fourth a cup of cold water, and
salt as needed, and turn into molds to
harden.

<p>1 teaspoonful of capers</p>
<p>1 truffle</p>
<p>Cooked yolks of 2 eggs</p>
</div></div>

<p>Let the first six ingredients simmer,
together, about fifteen minutes, then
add the gelatine that has been softened
in the cold water; stir over ice water
until the mixture begins to thicken,
then add the beans and olives, cut in
fine bits, the capers, the truffle or its
equivalent in trimmings, chopped fine,
the yolks sifted, or the equivalent of
the yolks in chopped chicken tongue
or ham. Mix thoroughly and turn
into molds. Serve with lettuce and
mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h3>Tomato Aspic</h3>

<p>To a pint of rich and highly-flavored
beef, chicken or veal broth add a cup
of cooked tomatoes, with salt and
pepper as needed, also one-third a
package of gelatine softened in one-third
a cup of cold water and the
crushed shells and slightly beaten
whites of two eggs; stir constantly
over the fire till boiling; let boil three
minutes; then draw to a cooler place
to settle; skim and strain through a
napkin wrung out of boiling water;
turn into molds and let chill.</p>

<h3>Good Flavored Cream of Corn Soup</h3>

<p>A good flavored corn soup may be
made of two parts milk flavored with
a little onion and parsley, thickened
with flour and one part corn purée;
but a richer flavored soup results
when chicken or veal broth is combined
with the milk and a little cream,
half to a whole cup to two quarts of
soup is used.</p>

<h3>Recipe for Cream of Corn Soup</h3>

<p>Score the kernels in each row with
a sharp knife and with the back of
the knife press out all of the pulp.
Melt three (level) tablespoonfuls of
butter, in it cook two slices of onion
and two branches of parsley until the
onion is softened and yellowed; add
three tablespoonfuls of flour, a dash of
black pepper and half a teaspoonful of
salt; stir and cook until frothy, then
add three cups of milk and stir until
boiling; add the corn pulp and let boil
five minutes. Add more seasoning if
needed. Vary by the use of broth or
cream.</p>

set a slice of hot ham above the toast
and the poached egg above the ham
and pour Hollandaise sauce over the

<h3>Hollandaise Sauce</h3>

<p>For six eggs, beat half a cup of
butter to a cream, then beat in, one

recipe for sponge cake published in
this magazine did not turn out successfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
We have given recipes for many
grades of sponge cake, but all have

results. Any recipe for good sponge
cake may be used for a jelly roll, but
some formulas will give a dry and
others a moist cake. The first of the
following recipes is for a small, inexpensive

<p>Beat the eggs without separating
the whites and yolks; beat in the
sugar, fold in the flour, salt and baking
powder, sifted together, then beat in
the milk. Bake in a shallow pan.
Turn upon a cloth, trim off the edges,
spread with jelly and roll. The cake
must be rolled while hot.</p>

<p class="center p2">II</p>
<div class="ctrdblk-container">

<p>5 eggs</p>
<p>1 cup of sugar</p>

<p>1 rounding teaspoonful of baking powder</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beat the whites and yolks separately,
and gradually beat the sugar into the
yolks; add the lemon juice and rind
and fold in the whites and flour. By
this recipe the cake is good only when
the ingredients are put together
properly. Beating and folding are
the motions needed. One not understanding
how to mix a <i>true</i> sponge
cake should omit the lemon juice and
use the baking powder. The recipe
for Swedish sponge cake, frequently
given in these pages, makes a good cake
for a jelly roll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Query 1627.</span>&mdash;"Recipe for Currants, Bar-le-duc."</p>

<h3>Bar-le-Duc Currants</h3>

<p>The preserve known by the above
caption can be made at home, but, as
the process of removing the seeds from
the currants is tedious, most people
prefer buying to making this preserve.
We have had good success with the
following recipe: Take selected currants
of large size, one by one, and with
tiny embroidery scissors carefully cut
the skin on one side, making a slit one-fourth
an inch or less in length. Through
this with a sharp needle remove the
seeds, one at a time, to preserve the
shape of the currant. Take the weight
of the currants in strained honey, and
when hot add the currants. Let simmer
two or three minutes, then seal as
jelly. If the juice of the currants
liquefy the honey too much, carefully
skim out the currants and reduce the
syrup at a gentle simmer to the desired
consistency, then replace the currants
and store as above.</p>

<p>The above recipe gives a confection
equal to that put up in France. The
following recipe, which entails less work,
gives a nice preserve.</p>

<h3>Currants, Bar-le-Duc</h3>

<p>Get the largest size currants, red or
white, and stem them without breaking.
To each pound allow three pounds
of sugar. Take some ordinary currants
and bruise them while warm until you
have a pint of juice. Put half a cup
of this into a porcelain kettle and add
three pounds of sugar. Bring slowly
to a boil and skim very carefully. After
boiling five minutes drop in very carefully
one pound of the large currants
and let simmer four minutes. Take
them out without breaking them, and
boil the syrup down five minutes, or
longer if not very thick; as the currants
are sometimes less juicy than at others,
a few minutes more will be needed at
one time than another. When thick,
skim well and strain through a hot
cloth over the fruit. Put into little
jelly glasses and when cold cover as
in jelly making.</p>

Crystallizing Ginger Root."</p>

<h3>Preserving Ginger Root</h3>

<p>Purchase the "stem" ginger. Take
the weight of the ginger in sugar.
Cover the ginger with boiling water
and let cook rapidly till very tender.
Dissolve the sugar in some of the water
in which the ginger was cooked. Use
about one-fourth as much water as
sugar. Let cook to a thin syrup; skim,
then put in the ginger and let simmer
very slowly till the syrup is nearly
absorbed, then cook more quickly,
stirring meanwhile to cause the sugar
to grain until the ginger is well glazed.
Or, remove the ginger from the syrup,
when it has absorbed a sufficient
quantity, drain, cut in strips and roll
in granulated sugar. A third method
gives good results, but for lack of
proper appliances is not used by
amateurs.</p>

Tamale. Also give the number of this
magazine in which a recipe for Cheese
Custard was given."</p>

<h3>Mexican Tamales</h3>

<p>Have a chicken cooked tender in
boiling water to cover; remove the
meat and chop it fine; return the bones
to the broth. From fresh corn husks
select a wide leaf of husk for each
tamale, or use dry husks steamed until
pliable. Remove and discard the seeds
from a dozen red chili peppers and
chop the pods very fine; peel six large
tomatoes and squeeze the seeds from
them. Mix the tomato and pepper and
let simmer twenty minutes, or until
well reduced. Stir enough of the hot
chicken liquor into three cups of corn
meal to thoroughly moisten it, then
let it stand half an hour. When everything
is ready, mix the tomato and
pepper with the chicken, adding a
teaspoonful or more of salt as is needed
to season. Salt should also be added to
the corn meal, if the broth in which it
was mixed had not been seasoned. Put
a layer of corn meal into the corn husk
and on this put two tablespoonfuls of
the chicken and tomato mixture. Let
the chicken come nearly to the ends of
the corn meal, and the corn meal well
up to the ends of the husk. Keeping
the husk between the fingers and the
meal, fold the meal over the chicken,
from each side, to enclose the chicken
completely; roll the husks over the
whole, turn up the ends and tie them
securely, using narrow strips torn from
the husks for the purpose. Put the
tamales on the top of the bones in the
chicken broth, taking care that the
bones keep them well out of the broth.
Cover closely and let simmer one hour.
Serve hot.</p>

</div>

<h3>Squire's Luncheon Tongue</h3>

<p>With a thin, sharp knife cut Squire's
Luncheon Tongue in thin slices. Serve
with hot spinach, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower,
Brussels sprouts, Swiss chard,
green corn, string or shell beans. To the
cooked vegetables add butter and a
palatable seasoning of salt and pepper.
For a more hearty dish serve the vegetables
with a cream sauce; if a still more
elaborate dish appeals to you, cover
the creamed vegetable with cracker
crumbs mixed with melted butter and
let stand in the oven until the crumbs
are nicely browned. When a cold dish
is desirable, serve the tongue with any
of the above vegetables dressed as a
salad. Any variety of salad dressing
may be used, but with spinach, sauce
tartare is particularly good. Press the
spinach while hot into molds; when
cold and firm unmold each shape on a
slice of tongue and dispose the sauce
above or around the spinach. To make
sauce tartare, add to a cup of mayonnaise
dressing two tablespoonfuls, each,
of fine chopped capers, olives, parsley
and cucumber pickles. French dressing&mdash;oil,
vinegar, salt and pepper&mdash;suffice
for lettuce and tomatoes served
with the tongue, though mayonnaise
or a boiled dressing made without oil
are to be commended with tomatoes,
thus served. A slice or two of the
tongue chopped fine is a good ingredient
with onion, bread crumbs and such
seasonings as are available for stuffed
tomatoes.</p>

<p><b>¶ This is a ready-to-serve cooked meat, its uses being the same as our Boiled Ham, for
sandwiches and as a cold meat, and is also fine for salads, or in any way in which a tongue is
used. ¶ The tongues are selected for size and quality, thoroughly cooked until tender, after
which all gristle and the little bone at the root is removed. ¶ They are packed in tins holding
twelve tongues and weighing about six pounds. ¶ After being placed in the tins, the tongues
are covered with a jelly, which, when it congeals, serves to bind the meat into one piece. Put
up in this form it is easy to slice thin, or, the tongues can be served whole if desired.
¶ The pans are carefully wrapped in parchment paper. ¶ The appearance is inviting, the
tongues are whole and the jelly keeps them fresh and retains their delicious flavor, possible in
no other way. ¶ These goods being sold within a short time after being cooked and packed,
they have a better flavor than canned tongue. ¶ The quality, purity and care in preparing
Luncheon Tongue is the same as that of all other Squire products. ¶ It is convenient, as any
quantity, from one slice to a whole pan, can be purchased.</b></p>

<h2 class="p6">The Father</h2>

<p class="center">A Story by Björnson</p>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
[This dramatic little tale by the late Björnstjerne Björnson is so simply told that it
seems almost destitute of art, which is to say its art is of the highest kind, for the art of
simplicity, as every writer knows, is the hardest to achieve. It was translated into English
a few weeks ago, for the first time, for the Boston <i>Transcript</i>, from which we reprint it.]</p>
</div>

<p>The man about whom this story
is told was the mightiest in his
parish. His name was Thord
Overaas. He stood one day in the
pastor's study, tall and serious. "I
have been given a son," he said, "and
wish to have him christened."</p>

<p>"What shall he be called?"</p>

<p>"Finn, after my father."</p>

<p>"And the sponsors?"</p>

<p>They were named, and were the best
men and women in the community of
the father's family.</p>

<p>"Is there anything further?" asked
the minister, looking up.</p>

<p>The peasant hesitated a little. "I
prefer to have him christened alone,"
he said.</p>

<p>"That is, on a week day?"</p>

<p>"On next Saturday, twelve, noon."</p>

<p>"Is there anything further?" asked
the pastor.</p>

<p>"There is nothing further."</p>

<p>The peasant fumbled his cap, as if he
were about to go. Then the pastor
rose.</p>

<p>"This much further," he said, and
walked over to Thord, took his hand
and looked him in the eyes. "God
grant that the child may be a blessing
to you."</p>

<p>Sixteen years after that day Thord
stood again in the pastor's study.</p>

<p>"You carry the years well, Thord,"
said the minister, seeing no change in
him.</p>

<p>"Neither have I any cares," answered
Thord.</p>

<p>To this the pastor remained silent,
but after a while he asked:</p>

<p>"What is your errand this evening?"</p>

<p>"This evening I come to see about
my son, who is to be confirmed tomorrow."</p>

<p>"He is a bright boy."</p>

<p>"I did not wish to pay the pastor
before I knew what number he is to
have on the floor."</p>

<p>"He shall stand number 1."</p>

<p>"So I heard&mdash;and here is ten dollars
for the pastor."</p>

<p>"Is there anything further?" asked
the minister looking up at Thord.</p>

<p>"There is nothing further." Thord
went away.</p>

<p>Again eight years passed, then a
noise was heard one day outside the
pastor's study, for many men came
and Thord first. The pastor looked up
and recognized him: "You come strong
in numbers this evening."</p>

<p>"I wish to ask to have the banns
pronounced for my son; he is to be
married to Karen Storliden, daughter
of Gudmund, who stands here."</p>

<p>"She is the richest girl in the parish."</p>

<p>"They say so," answered the peasant,
smoothing back his hair with one
hand.</p>

</div>

<p>The minister sat for a time as if in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
thought. He said nothing, but registered
the names in his books and the
men signed accordingly.</p>

<p>Thord laid three dollars on the
table.</p>

<p>"I should have only one," said the
pastor.</p>

<p>"I know it, too, but he is my only
child&mdash;I wish to do well by you."
The pastor took the money. "It is
the third time now you stand here in
behalf of your son, Thord."</p>

<p>"But now I am through with him,"
said Thord. He folded his pocketbook
together, said good-by and went. The
men followed slowly after.</p>

<p>A fortnight after that day the father
and son rowed in calm weather across
the water to Storliden to confer about
the wedding. "This board does not
lie securely under me," said the son,
and got up to lay it aright. Just then
the plank on which he stood slipped;
he threw out his arms, gave a cry and
fell in the water. "Take hold of
the oar!" called the father, rising and
holding it toward him. But when the
son had made a few strokes he stiffened.
"Wait a little!" cried the father, and
rowed nearer. Then the son turned
over backwards, gave a long look at
the father&mdash;and sank.</p>

<p>Thord would not believe it. He
held the boat still and stared at the spot
where his son had sunk down as if he
were to come up again. Some bubbles
rose to the surface, then a few more,
then just one large one that burst&mdash;and
the sea lay again like a mirror.</p>

<p>For three days and three nights they
saw the father rowing about that spot
without food or sleep; he was searching
for his son. On the third day in
the morning he found him, and came
carrying him up over the hills to his
farm.</p>

<p>A year perhaps had passed since that
day. Then the pastor, late one autumn
evening, heard something in the hallway
outside his door fumbling cautiously
for the latch. The minister
opened the door and in stepped a tall,
bent man, thin and white-haired. The
minister looked long at him before he
recognized him; it was Thord.</p>

<p>"Do you come so late?" said the
pastor and stood still before him.</p>

<p>"O, yes, I come late," said Thord,
seating himself.</p>

<p>The pastor also sat down as if waiting.
There was a long silence, then
Thord said: "I have something with
me that I wish to give to the poor; it
shall be in the form of a legacy and
carry my son's name." He got up,
laid money on the table and sat down
again.</p>

<p>The pastor counted the money.
"That is a great deal," he said.</p>

<p>"It is half of my farm; I sold it
today."</p>

<p>The minister remained sitting a long
time in silence; finally he asked gently,
"What are you now going to do,
Thord?"</p>

<p>"Something better."</p>

<p>They sat for a time, Thord with his
eyes upon the floor, and the pastor
with his eyes upon Thord. Finally the
pastor said slowly: "Now I believe
your son has finally become a blessing
to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, now I also think so myself,"
said Thord.</p>

<p>He looked up and two tears rolled
heavily down over his face.&mdash;<i>Current

<h3 class="p6">The Secret of It</h3>

<p>"Rita"&mdash;so Mrs. Desmond Humphreys,
the English novelist, is called&mdash;was
condemning in New York the
frequency of divorce in America.</p>

<p>"You Americans," she said, "don't
seem to possess the secret of matrimonial
happiness. Perhaps you might
take a lesson from a city clerk I heard
of recently.</p>

<p>"A friend of this clerk's, after visiting
him at his home, said: 'Excuse me,
Will, but how do you manage, on your
small salary, to have such well cooked
and delicious meals?'</p>

<p>"'The secret is simple,' Will replied;
'every day I kiss the cook and do all
I can to please her and make her happy.'</p>

<p>"'But doesn't your wife object?'
the other asked.</p>

<p>"'Dear no&mdash;she's the cook,' was
the reply."</p>

<p>One fall Farmer True sold a large
part of his hay in order to buy some
new green blinds for his house and a
smart kitchen clock. The neighbors
heartily disapproved. Spring came,
and with it the downfall of his pride,
for alas! he had not hay enough to
feed his cattle until they should be
turned out to grass. Thereupon he
humbly sought a neighbor, and asked
him if he had any hay to lend. "Well,"
said the neighbor, deliberately, stroking
his chin, "I dunno's I've got any
hay to lend, an' I dunno's I've got any
to sell. Why don't ye drive yer cattle
up an' let 'em look at yer green blinds
an' hear yer clock strike?" But he
sold him some just the same.

<h3 class="p6">How to Utilize Bacon Grease</h3>

<p>Bacon grease is the best available
medium for frying. It is the most
toothsome and the purest. Contrast
the clean lines and flavor of bacon
grease with the insipid, ghastly-looking
product known as lard, made from
who knows what. Pure leaf lard is
rare, and even at its best the rich,
tempting savor of bacon is vastly preferable.</p>

<p>Bacon, properly prepared for those
who do not engage in heavy manual
labor and therefore do not need much
of the rich heat producing fat, should
be fried to a crisp, until it is to all
intents entirely lean. Then it is a dish
fit for gods, and for mortals who know
what is good. Then there is left the
grease, golden brown and delicious.
Now the usefulness of bacon only begins.</p>

<p>Hear this! From one pound of
breakfast bacon you get one pint of
precious bacon grease.</p>

<p>What do with it? That's easy.</p>

<p>Fry eggs in it. You will never again
use lard. Even butter is inferior to it.</p>

<p>Season boiled string beans with it.
It is a substitute for cooking bacon with
them. Two or three tablespoonfuls
will give the proper flavor. Use the
bacon fat in place of butter or lard.</p>

<p>On a festive occasion Mr. Jones,
who is by nature courtesy itself, complimented
a middle-aged lady upon
her dress, the upper part of which was
of black lace. "Nothing," said he,
"to my mind is so becoming as black
and yellow." "Yellow!" she cried.

After all juice has been extracted by

continue pressing operation. This latter
will yield a darker colored juice and
not so delicate in flavor as the juice
extracted by the cold process. In bottling

separately. Cold process juice must be
heated to the boiling point before it is

<p class="p6">One of the greatest aids and "step-savers"
for the woman who does her
own work is a "Wheel-Tray."</p>

<p>Its cost represents not more than
you'd have to pay a domestic for two
or three weeks.</p>

<p>The advantage of <i>this</i> helper is that
it is always ready, never wants "an
evening off," never argues, never sulks
and is always "Bridget on the spot,"
if we may be permitted this adaptation
of the well-known phrase.</p>

<p>Ten dollars for the Wheel-Tray will
save you hundreds of dollars' worth of
labor, worry and time. Those who have
used it say they cannot now get along
without it.</p>

<p>It will last for years, has no breakable
or intricate parts and glides about
like a silent, well-trained butler.</p>

<p>In addition to its help in kitchen and
dining-room, some use it sweeping days,
taking the small articles out of a room
before sweeping. It saves many steps
in one home in distributing the freshly-ironed
clothes to their respective bureau
drawers.</p>

<p class="center">By Mrs. JANET MCKENZIE HILL, Editor The Boston Cooking-School Magazine</p>

<p>Salads and chafing-dish dainties are destined to receive in the
future more attention from the progressive housekeeper than has as
yet been accorded to them. In the past their composition and consumption
has been left chiefly to that portion of the community "who
cook to please themselves." But since women have become anxious
to compete with men in every walk of life, they, too, are desirous to
become adepts in tossing up an appetizing salad or in stirring a
creamy rarebit. The author has aimed to make it the most practical and
reliable treatise on these fascinating branches of the culinary art that has
yet been published. Due attention has been given to the a b c of the subjects, and great care
exercised to meet the actual needs of those who wish to cultivate a taste for palatable and wholesome
dishes, or to cater to the vagaries of the most capricious appetites. The illustrations are
designed to accentuate, or make plain, a few of the artistic effects that may be produced by
various groupings or combinations of simple and inexpensive materials.</p>

<p>
We will mail "Salads, Sandwiches and Chafing-Dish Dainties," postpaid, on receipt
of price, $1.50, or as a premium for three new yearly subscriptions to the magazine.</p>

<h3 class="p6">Important Legal Decision</h3>

<p>The Liebig's Extract of Meat Company
of London, makers of the celebrated
Liebig's Extract of Meat, has
gained an important victory in its suit
against the Liebig Extract Company
of Hudson and Thomas streets, New
York City, by the decision recently
handed down of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.</p>

<p>The principal issue was as to the
right of the Liebig Company of London
to exclusive ownership in the name
"<i>Liebig</i>," and the Appellate Court has
now given a decision, with heavy costs
against the Liebig Extract Company
of New York, and enjoins that company
from using the word "<i>Liebig</i>" in
connection with the sale of extract of
meat. Since this decision is final and
not subject to further appeal, it should
mark the end of infringements on the
original and genuine Liebig Extract
of Meat made by Liebig's Extract of
Meat Company of London, under rights
acquired from the eminent Baron
Justus von Liebig, whose facsimile signature
"J. v. Liebig," in blue, is a
prominent feature of the package.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>A negro, says Mr. Thomas Kane in
the <i>Interior</i>, was pressed to tell why he
had left the Methodists and joined the
Episcopal Church. "Why did you
do it?" was the question. "Well,"
he replied, "we is moh oddehly; we has
moh style." "Yes, but what do you
do?" "Well, fo' one thing, we has responsible
readin's." "Well, what else?"
"Well, we has Roman candles on de

<p class="center">
First Opportunity Ever Given to the Ladies of America
to Profit by the Mdme. DuBarrie Positive French
Method of Bust Development</p>

<p>Many women believe that
the bust cannot be developed
or brought back to its former
vigorous condition. Thousands
of women have vainly
used massage, electricity,
pump instruments, creams,
ointments, general tonics,
constitutional treatments,
exercises and other methods
without results.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Any Woman May Now</b><br />
<b>Develop Her Bust</b></p>

<p>Mdme. DuBarrie will explain
to any woman the plain
truth in regard to bust development,
the reason for
failure and the way
to success. The
<b>Mdme. DuBarrie
Positive French
Method</b> is different
from anything else
ever brought before American women. By this method
any lady&mdash;young, middle aged or elderly&mdash;may develop
her bust from <b>2 to 8 inches in 30 days</b>, and see definite
results in 3 to 5 days, no matter what the cause of the
lack of development. It is based on scientific facts,
absolutely safe and lasting. <i>For complete illustrated

<p>The story of American industrial development has no more
fascinating or impressive chapter than that devoted to the
discoveries and improvements resulting from the extraordinary
inventive genius of the New England workman.</p>

<p>He is never content with things as they are. He is forever
experimenting&mdash;and successfully. He searches until he finds
the soul of the machine, and from this intimate acquaintance
he begins to eliminate and improve. He accomplishes
the paradox of perfecting a perfect article. If there is
a practicable way to make one part do the work of two,
if some added device will simplify a process or improve a
product, he will not rest till he has worked out the problem.</p>

<p>This passion for invention has been from the first a vigorous
characteristic of the New England mind. The early settlers
were artisans rather than tillers of the soil; and when by a
bitter struggle with an undeveloped country they had supplied
their immediate wants, they naturally turned again to manufacturing;
and this mechanical bent, stimulated to alertness
by a vigorous climate, resulted in course of time in an almost
incredible mechanical ingenuity&mdash;the "Yankee Knack."</p>

<p>This genius for simplification of processes, this wonderful
knack of devising machinery which will do the work of the
human hand, has multiplied the output of our factories: and
this in turn has increased wages and decreased the hours of
labor, and so brought a great uplift into the lives of our
workmen; given them the power to provide better homes for
their families, better education for their children, and greater
leisure in which to work out a broader destiny for themselves.</p>

<p>As in the past, so in the present and the future. The "Yankee
Knack," which long since turned New England into a vast
workshop, is still at its age-long task&mdash;simplifying, improving;
lowering cost of production, ever raising quality of
product&mdash;and all to the end that the average American family
shall enjoy today what were luxuries but yesterday, and
gratify in their turn the yet undiscovered desires of tomorrow.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Ivory Soap is not an ordinary laundry soap.</b><br />
<b>It is a better-than-ordinary soap.</b></p>

<p>It is made of <i>better-than-ordinary</i>
materials and is intended to be used
for <i>better-than-ordinary</i> purposes.</p>

<p>There are any number of soaps that
cut dirt much more quickly than Ivory
Soap will. They are fine&mdash;for cleaning
pots and pans and cement walks.</p>

<p>But don't wash shirtwaists with
them; or woolens; or colored goods;
or silks; or dainty dress fabrics; or
laces; or any other article that is <i>better-than-ordinary</i>.</p>

<p>For cleaning things of that kind, Ivory
Soap is so much better than anything
else that it really has no competitor.</p>

<p>And the reason is simply this:
Ivory Soap is pure. It contains no
"free" alkali. It is the mildest, gentlest
soap it is possible to make. It
cleans&mdash;<i>but it does not injure</i>.</p>

<p>Most cleaning preparations are adapted for
<i>coarse work</i> in the kitchen only.</p>

<p>Something else has to be used for the <i>finer
articles</i> in other parts of the house.</p>

<p>Bon Ami can be used for <i>all cleaning purposes</i>.</p>

<p>Every housekeeper knows that for use on
windows, glassware and mirrors, it is absolutely
unapproached. It gives a brilliancy
to the glass that nothing else can duplicate.</p>

<p>For bathroom work&mdash;on nickel ware and
porcelain, it is equally effective.</p>

<p>For use on painted woodwork and linoleum
it is ideal. It does not scratch away the
surface, but simply <i>cleans it</i>.</p>

<p>For brass, copper, etc., it is far better than
coarse caustic powders.</p>

<p>It has still other uses, such as removing grime
from the hands and cleaning white canvas
shoes.</p>

<p>In fact, Bon Ami polishes and cleans almost
every kind of surface.</p>

<p>And it does this
without injuring
or roughening the
hands or the article
upon which
it is used.</p>
